Due to the significant uncertainties and dynamic variables, modeling real estate has been studied as complex systems. In this study, a novel machine learning method is proposed to tackle real estate modeling complexity. Call detail records (CDR) provides excellent opportunities for in-depth investigation of the mobility characterization. This study explores the CDR potential for predicting the real estate price with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). Several essential mobility entropy factors, including dweller entropy, dweller gyration, workers' entropy, worker gyration, dwellers' work distance, and workers' home distance, are used as input variables. The prediction model is developed using the machine learning method of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) trained with the evolutionary algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO). Model performance is evaluated using mean square error (MSE), sustainability index (SI), and Willmott's index (WI). The proposed model showed promising results revealing that the workers' entropy and the dwellers' work distances directly influence the real estate price. However, the dweller gyration, dweller entropy, workers' gyration, and the workers' home had a minimum effect on the price. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow of activities and entropy of mobility are often associated with the regions with lower real estate prices.",The authors would like to thank Vodafone Hungary for providing the CDR data.

The property or real estate industry is currently undergoing a digital transformation. Property technology (proptech) is one of the driving forces for this transformation and enablers to establish a more sustainable society. This paper investigates the Norwegian market through 154 proprietary proptech established between 2013 – 2023. The aim is to understand how proprietary proptech are influencing the business practices and how the real estate industry’s overall capacity, efforts, and resources have been allocated in developing novel proptech. Three theoretical frameworks sociotechnical systems (STS), diffusion of innovation, and sustainability transitions, have been used to investigate how proptech influences the real estate industry and FM. The results suggest there are innovations coming from at least two unexpected places, namely customised modules moving faster than proprietary proptech, and game changers enabled by feedback loops from late stage and FM big data to early stage property development.",,,IOP Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science,,,,2023-05-01,2023,,2023-05-01,1176,1,012002,All OA; Gold,Article,"Phan, T; Boge, K","Phan, T (Department of Property and Law, Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU)); Boge, K (Department of Property and Law, Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU))",,"Phan, T (Norwegian University of Life Sciences); Boge, K (Norwegian University of Life Sciences)",1,1,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/1176/1/012002/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157861255,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 37 Earth Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences",

This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology’s practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders—consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries—and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers’ needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers’ needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets. The study, being the first to explore real estate technologies, is limited by the number of research publications on the SRE technologies that has been compensated through incorporation of online reports.",,This research received no external funding.,Sustainability,,,,2018-09-03,2018,2018-09-03,,10,9,3142,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ullah, Fahim; Sepasgozar, Samad M.

As they re-emerge from the Covid 19 pandemic and get ready to face climate change and other, potentially existential threats, they need to look for new ways to support wealth and wellbeing creation – leveraging Big Data and AI and suing them into their physical reality and to become greener, more inclusive and resilient, hence sustainable. This book describes how new digital technologies could be used to design digital and physical twins of cities that are able to feed into each other to optimize their working and ability to create new wealth and wellbeing. The book also describes how to increase cities’ social and economic resilience during crisis time and addressing their almost fatal weaknesses – as it became all too obvious during the recent COVID 19 crisis. Also, the book presents a framework for a critical discussion of the concept of “smart-city”, suggesting its development into a “cyber” and “meta” one – meaning, not only digital systems can allow physical ones (e.g. cities, citizens, households and companies) to become “smarter”, but also the vice versa is true, as off line data and real life behaviours can support the optimization and development of virtual brains as a sum of big data and artificial intelligence apps all sitting “over the cloud”. An analysis of the fundamental dynamics of this emerging “info-telligence” economy, and of the potential role of big digital players like Amazon, Google and Facebook is then paving the way to discuss a few strategic forays on how traditional sectors such as financial services, real estate, TMT or health could also evolve, leveraging Big Data and AI in a cyber-physical integrated setting. Finally, a number of thought provoking use cases that could be designed around individuals, and to improve the success and the resilience of households and companies living and working in urban areas are discussed, as an example of one of the most exciting future markets to come: the one of global, sustainable cities",,,,,,,2021,2021,,2021,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Scardovi, Claudio","Scardovi, Claudio (HOPE SpA, Milan, Italy)",,"Scardovi, Claudio (HOPE SpA, Milan, Italy)",4,2,,4.44,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136721826,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

In the following paper, we discuss the function of analytics and artificial intelligence in transforming lead management in the real estate industry. Conventional methods of lead prioritizing involve the rote use of the gut feeling of a salesperson, which, although inefficient, leaves much room for potential errors. Incorporating AI and analytics lead management thrust real estate agents into data analysis, where agents can make predictive and behavioral decisions based on stated data. Through lead scoring tools and other intelligent platforms such as AI, an agent can determine high probable lead conversion, directing efforts to more converting leads. Furthermore, this paper examines the use of big data analytics in predicting market trends and buying behavior to improve the position of agents competing in a highly technological marketplace. The paper also discusses changes in buyers' needs, including the interest in customization and environmental sustainability, which are gaining importance in lead selection processes. For this, adopting these technologies not only makes operations more efficient but also assists agents in building better client relations by initiating marketing that would capture the clients' interest and subsequently follow up on them. The lead management of the real estate industry will only improve due to enhanced artificial intelligence and analytics in the future.

Proptech startups are important change agents in accelerating building digitalization. While many researchers analyze economic and environmental savings from deployment of digital technology, far less attention has been devoted to challenges for proptech startups to transform efficiency gains into viable businesses. We analyze the Unissu global proptech startup database to reveal the scope and competitive landscape of proptech solutions. We conduct interviews with building owners/operators to understand what impedes the adoption of proptech solutions. Despite rapid growth, ongoing challenges remain for sustainability-focused proptech firms with three adoption barriers: (1) integration of the technology stacks; (2) integration of technology stacks with business processes; and (3) integration of owner/operators and the occupants’ solutions. Proptech with applications that work with existing infrastructure or provide more complete holistic solutions with extensive capital reserves, are more likely to survive. Other pathways include having data standardization and security protocols in place; technology partnership with technology incumbents; and effective communication with owners/operators to fill the knowledge gap. Findings can provide insights to emerging digital proptech startups as they spearhead market adoption in the real estate sector and monetize the sustainability value creation.","We thank Professor Siqi Zheng for encouraging us to start this research and providing critical feedback.

This study is based on qualitative research in which data were collected from interviews with real estate development specialists. The interviews were addressed to a total of 30 real estate developers from Romania between July and December 2022 and were conducted using the Zoom interface. The aim of this research was to analyze whether familiarity with the smart green concept influences the decision to implement the IoT on a large scale at the organizational level through the perception of specific determining factors in choosing the development of green building projects considering the operational costs. The results revealed a significant indirect effect of green building knowledge on large-scale IoT implementation through the mediator of the perception of operating cost factors, supporting our hypothesis. The direct effect in the presence of the mediator was not found to be significant anymore.

As the sector is recognised as a critical stakeholder in sustainability, the research analyses whether blockchain could aid in streamlining operations, enhancing accountability in governance, and promoting equity in housing allocation. The data were collected with a mixed-method approach of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys with 50 contributors who are real estate practitioners, blockchain experts, and ESG analysts. Key findings show that blockchain can be used to monitor carbon footprint, support fractional ownership, and create a trustless housing allocation system. Other governance improvements, through immutable records and real-time compliance tracking, were identified as key advances. Out of the real-life scenarios in a Malaysian context, there is land registry blockchain, green building certifications, and mostly all the technology is transformative.

We expect such technologies to improve quality of life and the productivity of cities over the long run.We forecast that smart city technologies will reinforce the primacy of the most successful global metropolises at least for a decade or more. A few select metropolises in emerging countries may also leverage these technologies to leapfrog on the provision of local public services. In the long run, all cities throughout the urban system will end up adopting successful and cost-effective smart city initiatives. Nevertheless, smaller scale interventions are likely to crop up everywhere, even in the short run. Such targeted programs are more likely to improve conditions in blighted or relatively deprived neighborhoods, which could generate gentrification and higher valuations there.It is unclear whether urban information systems will have a centralizing or suburbanizing impact. They are likely to make denser urban centers more attractive, but they are also bound to make suburban or exurban locations more accessible.","We would like to thank Professor William Wheaton for his feedback on an earlier draft and his valuable contribution to the section on future opportunities.

Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future.","This work was supported by the National Key RD Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0607203), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program of China (2019QZKK0405), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (4187118541971271), and the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954303).",,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2020-11,2020,,2020-11,273,,123142,Closed,Article,"Kong, Lingqiang; Liu, Zhifeng; Wu, Jianguo","Kong, Lingqiang (Center for Human-Environment System Sustainability (CHESS), State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology (ESPRE), Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; School of Natural Resources, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China); Liu, Zhifeng (Center for Human-Environment System Sustainability (CHESS), State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology (ESPRE), Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China; School of Natural Resources, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China); Wu, Jianguo (School of Life Sciences and School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85287, USA; Center for Human-Environment System Sustainability (CHESS), State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology (ESPRE), Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China)","Liu, Zhifeng (Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University)","Kong, Lingqiang (Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University); Liu, Zhifeng (Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University); Wu, Jianguo (Arizona State University; Beijing Normal University)",131,70,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129387105,33 Built Environment and Design; 40 Engineering,

 (1) RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
 This study conducted research on Korean real estate and trust facing the new normal. The purpose of the thesis is to explore the problems and future that arise from the combination of Korean real estate and artificial intelligence amid changes in the rules of the game called the new normal. This paper pointed out the importance of social capital called trust and explored the sustainability of the Korean real estate industry.
 (2) RESEARCH METHOD
 This study applied descriptive research methods to new normal, artificial intelligence, real estate in Korea, and trusts. Through this, the paper attempted to discuss research topics in an explanatory and normative manner and draw implications.
 (3) RESEARCH FINDINGS
 This study was conducted on the topic of real estate and trust in the new normal. The main keywords of this research were new normal, Korean real estate, trust, Artificial Intelligence(AI), and the 4th industrial revolution(4IR). This paper differs from previous studies. Existing prior research approaches the 4IR(AI) and Korean real estate with a focus on economic utility and technological benefit. In contrast, this study pointed out the importance of social capital called trust and attempted to explore the sustainability of the Korean real estate industry.
 2. RESULTS
 In the new normal, real estate in Korea is presented as three major issues: 1. Problems of Korean real estate in transition, 2. Industrial revolution and collapse of trust, and 3. Transformation of the times and changes in social codes. In relation to this, this study derived three implications: first, compliance with the rule of law, second, discussion and direction on ethical guidelines, and third, response and preparation for information asymmetry and bias. This study predicts that Korea's real estate industry, facing a new normal, will minimize risks based on trust and develop the benefits and utilities provided by artificial intelligence and intelligent information technology in a desirable direction.",,,Korea Real Estate Academy,,,,2024-02-29,2024,2024-02-29,2024-02-29,93,,71-85,Closed,Article,"Kim, Kyung Dong","Kim, Kyung Dong ()",,"Kim, Kyung Dong ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169039954,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

The findings point towards the highest relevance of the localisation factor, but also at the relatively low importance of the features of a sustainable building: building automation and information technology systems, as well as energy efficiency or certification. The findings suggest that despite the growing interest in sustainability and technological advancement amongst office market participants in Krakow, the relative importance of smart and green building features in their decision-making processes is relatively low. The study has some interesting practical implications. The knowledge regarding the relative importance of decision criteria can be valuable for developers and investors because the anticipation of tenants’ expectations is directly linked with return on investment and innovation premiums.",,This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland within “Regional Initiative of Excellence” Programme for 2019-2022 (Project no.: 021/RID/2018/19) and by the Faculty of Economics and International Relations of Cracow University of Economics in frames of a grant awarded to maintain its research potential.,Administrative Sciences,,,,2019-07-19,2019,2019-07-19,,9,3,52,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gluszak, Michal; Gawlik, Remigiusz; Zieba, Malgorzata","Gluszak, Michal (Department of Real Estate and Investment Economics, Cracow University of Economics, Ul.

However, as urban migration increases globally, slum populations are outstripping cities’ capacity to provide accommodation for new residents and to deliver on their Agenda 2030 Goal 11 targets. To try and solve this problem, the temptation for city planners, urbanists and politicians is to design and build quickly and cheaply. These budget constraints often result in expensive projects that eventually fail to deliver on inclusiveness, safety, resilience, and sustainability. Recent advances in Computer Aided Design (CAD) and algorithm-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) allow design systems to be programmed with the successful built environment pattern elements described by the design code, thus generating buildings adapted to their precise location.

Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating all economic sectors, and its impact will be transformational. Much has been written about AI, and pundits are weighing in on how it will affect corporate real estate (CRE) in fundamental ways.

As the middle-income millennials’ and Gen Zs’ purchasing power rises, these increasingly important consumer groups might fall prey to online RE colorums or make bad RE investment decisions. In anticipation of big data, ML, and AI becoming integral to the Philippine RE industry, this study extends the theory of the planned behavior model to account for RE investment and illegal practice and to build a theoretical basis for foundational models. A total of 400 Filipinos aged 15 to 42 from different regions in the country responded to a self-administered online survey questionnaire. The model was assessed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and was proven to be sufficient to explain the proposed model. Results from the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) revealed that during inflation, risk tolerance (RT), perceived property value (PPV), and aversion from illegal practice (IP) significantly influence millennials’ and Gen Zs’ intention to invest in the RE market, implying that they would consider prioritizing profitability at the expense of sustainability.

1848,pub.1185273422,10.1049/tje2.70063,,,Dynamic smart contracts framework on Ethereum private blockchain for real estate management,"Abstract Blockchain technology enables the recording of information in an immutable manner, making it extremely difficult or nearly impossible to alter, hack, or manipulate. Its adoption is expected to enhance long‐term economic sustainability across various industries, including real estate. Traditional real estate transactions typically involve third‐party intermediaries to record and validate informal transactions. However, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the real estate sector by transforming how properties are bought and sold. Features such as efficiency, transparency, process automation through smart contracts, robust consensus mechanisms, and enhanced security measures can reshape the real estate landscape by increasing efficiency and reducing costs. This paper explores the challenges currently faced by the real estate industry and reviews the literature on the disruptive impact of blockchain technology in this sector. A conceptual framework for a private blockchain is proposed based on the Ethereum platform, utilizing proof of authority as the consensus mechanism, specifically designed for property transactions. The proposed model integrates self‐sovereign identity for secure and decentralized identity management, incorporates digital wallets for transaction management, and leverages smart contracts to automate processes. This approach enhances transparency in digital transactions, thereby fostering greater trust between users and service provider.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research work of Muhammad Faheem is supported by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd., Espoo.

This research fundamentally discusses the role of AI in achieving sustainable maintenance through its strategies to extend the assumed lifespan of the building and preserve residential real estate assets. This research assumes that the implementation of intelligent exploratory methods offers an effective solution by enabling unsupervised algorithms to efficiently find deviants from a large amount of data. AI is beneficial for both real-time and post-event processing. Where it can be applied to activate large amounts of data and have a chance of making sense of the data, various solutions can be achieved for sustainable maintenance in residential buildings to bridge the gap between the different sustainable maintenance programmes and their actual application, which is the primary objective of the research. The researcher will employ a theoretical framework to elucidate the concepts of sustainable maintenance, the assumed lifespan of a building, and AI applications. Subsequently, an analytical framework was used to analyze various international projects (the case studies) and identify the various strengths resulting. then will conclude by employing an applied framework to facilitate the implementation of smart exploratory methods through the benefits of results and recommendations to achieve sustainable maintenance, prolong the assumed lifespan of the building, and preserve residential real estate assets. Special Issue of AEIC 2024 (Sustainable Architecture and Urban Design Session)",,,Journal of Al-Azhar University Engineering Sector,,,,2024-07-01,2024,2024-07-01,2024-07-01,19,72,200-219,Closed,Article,"Mohamed, Norhan Abdelwahab; Khorshid, Khaled Moustafa; Hassan, Mohamed Sobhy","Mohamed, Norhan Abdelwahab (Ministry of Housing and Utilities, The new administrative capital, Cairo, Egypt; Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering, Al-Azhar University, Nasr City, 11884, Cairo, Egypt); Khorshid, Khaled Moustafa (Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering, Al-Azhar University, Nasr City, 11884, Cairo, Egypt); Hassan, Mohamed Sobhy (Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering, Al-Azhar University, Nasr City, 11884, Cairo, Egypt)",,"Mohamed, Norhan Abdelwahab (Ministry of Housing and Utilities, The new administrative capital, Cairo, Egypt; Al Azhar University); Khorshid, Khaled Moustafa (Al Azhar University); Hassan, Mohamed Sobhy (Al Azhar University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174677614,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 3302 Building; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

So far, no instrument includes all sustainability dimensions in all phases of real estate, due to the heterogeneity of the underlying data. In addition, the leverage of the digital transformation in the sustainability transition is yet to be addressed. The aim of this study is how a meta-instrument should be structured to overcome the existing contradictory challenges in sustainability and to enable sustainable decision-making and management for real estate owners. This study examines this question by applying the following methodological approach: 61 literature studies were re-viewed, and concepts and systems were examined, which contain partial solutions at individual levels, be it for sustainability assessment, for the monetarization of sustainability aspects or for the maturity of technical systems. These instruments have their shortcomings as they only map individual aspects, but do not offer a comprehensive life cycle management solution for portfolio holders. Within the framework of this study, a new concept for a tool was developed, allowing to combine the various levels of real estate life cycle, sustainability, and digitalisation in a single holistic model. This multidimensional model was optimised using experts’ opinions collected in 2 workshops. The first results reveal the applicability of the developed instrument but remains difficult to manage by potential users.

It helps asset owners to draft unique and tailored product offerings with access to broad groups of investors, exit opportunities and limited risk of fraud. Nevertheless, potential hazards to the process and the very concept exist. The near perspective of a private stablecoin threatening the financial system puts pressure on governments, regulators and the banking system to adopt the revolution rather than oppose it. Tokenization of residential real estate assets opens vast opportunities for inclusion of traditional financial institutions in the process via oracle services, as the quality of data exposed to the asymmetry of information and other factors particular to this market segment is crucial. The author believes that retail banks should further leverage their role in the economy, given their business experience, local expertise or trust, and drafts a concept of the Oracle Bank operating at the crossroads of the physical and digital worlds. This organization should emerge from the unstoppable process of the financial paradigm shift. The discussion on the institutional adoption of residential property tokenization should not be limited to the security of transactions but reflect other aspects of the inevitable redefinition of the banking sector’s role in the emerging token economy, with residential real estate at the focus point of future socio-economic development plans.",,,Springer Proceedings in Business and Economics,"Digitalization, Digital Transformation and Sustainability in the Global Economy","Tim A.

This paper delves into this endeavor, highlighting the transformative impact of specifically chosen contextual open data and recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) to improve the accuracy and transparency of real estate price predictions within smart cities. Focusing on Lisbon’s dynamic housing market from 2018 to 2021, we integrate diverse open data sources into an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model optimized with the Optuna hyperparameter framework to enhance its predictive precision. Our initial model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of EUR 51,733.88, which was significantly reduced by 8.24% upon incorporating open data features. This substantial improvement underscores open data’s potential to boost real estate price predictions. Additionally, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to address the transparency of our model. This approach clarifies the influence of each predictor on price estimates and fosters enhanced accountability and trust in AI-driven real estate analytics. The findings of this study emphasize the role of XAI and the value of open data in enhancing the transparency and efficacy of AI-driven urban development, explicitly demonstrating how they contribute to more accurate and insightful real estate analytics, thereby informing and improving policy decisions for the sustainable development of smart cities.",The authors would like to express their gratitude to Confidencial Imobiliário for graciously providing the real estate transactions data that supported this work.,"This research was funded by FCT—Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, I.P.

However, there are several challenges in both direct and indirect investment mechanisms affecting its social and financial sustainability. These challenges include high costs, lengthy processes, limited transparency, and restricted investor control. Additionally, the dominance of large investors in the market intensifies these issues, creating barriers to smaller investors. This raises concerns around social inequality and sustainability among small investors, that represent, in number, the largest share of investors. Blockchain technology has emerged as a possible solution to address these issues in the real estate sector, with the potential to improve its long term social and financial sustainability. Features such as smart contracts and tokenization can enhance efficiency, transparency, security, and accessibility in property transactions. In the case of smart contracts, these enable self-executing and automated agreements, and tokenization allows for fractional ownership and increased liquidity. To assess the knowledge and perceptions of professionals in the real estate sector and evaluate the possible impact of the technology in the market, a survey-based methodology was followed. It targeted individuals actively involved in the industry, including professionals from real estate investment companies and real estate agencies. The data revealed that most professionals in the Portuguese real estate market have little to no knowledge about blockchain technology. Yet, those who possess knowledge recognize the potential benefits it can bring to the industry.

In the area of building energy efficiency, closely coupled with this effort is the prevalence of building energy benchmarking policies, which require public disclosure of vast new quantities of building-level energy data at urban scales (i.e., open urban energy data). While existing research efforts have focused on the potential of this data to transform energy efficiency markets and investments in the real estate sector, little research has been dedicated to assessing this information’s value to the general public. Given that achieving energy reductions in the built environment will require not only energy efficiency investments, but also greater awareness, engagement, and action from ordinary citizens, we study the potential of open urban energy data in providing citizen benefits. Energy-cyber-physical systems offer a pertinent framework to link data from the virtual world to citizens’ physical reality in order to improve their understanding and decision making. Adopting an energy-cyber-physical system perspective, we aim to connect open urban energy data to citizens through the development and evaluation of a novel community-scale energy feedback system. This mobile cyber-physical system transforms building-level electricity consumption and production data across Georgia Tech’s campus into a mobile application consisting of three features: spatial feedback, energy supply feedback, and energy consumption feedback. Augmented-reality visualization elements are integrated into the system, providing Georgia Tech community members a direct link between their experienced physical environment and data stored in the virtual world. Applying a user-centered design approach, prospective users evaluate the system via thinking aloud sessions and user surveys to assess understandings and perceptions of open urban energy data for the Georgia Tech campus. The results contribute to literature seeking to create energy feedback systems at the community-scale and expand research investigating citizen reactions to and opinions of open urban energy data. This research is an integral step to further engagement and participation from the public to help achieve a sustainable and citizen-valued energy future.","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. DGE-1650044 and No. CPS-1837021.

1601,pub.1152457658,10.1007/978-3-031-07535-3_8,,,Information-Theoretic Approaches to Blockchain Scalability,"Blockchain systems fundamentally provide an environment of distributed trust in networks by creating individual copies of cryptographically secure ledgers of all transactions on the network at each node in the network. This redundant storage when combined with democratized transaction validation and the security from recording the ledgers as hash chains enable a self-sustainable system of distributed trust. However, the principal source of security and fairness of blockchain systems is from every participating node maintaining a local record of all transactions in the network. This in turn implies a significant amount of storage cost that scales prohibitively with larger block sizes, higher transaction volume, greater size of the network, and time in use. In this chapter, we will take a few blockchain applications as examples and highlight the storage and communication demands for maintaining a full node in the network. We then study some approaches with roots in coding theory that aim to reduce this cost and enable network scaling. Finally, we study some practical use cases in establishing distributed trust in computational systems using coding-theoretic methods.","The authors would like to thank Kush R.

This research contributes to the nascent literature on digital finance in real estate crowdfunding, and its potential of being applied to public housing. The idea of such a platform on the blockchain is this paper’s second conceptual innovation. The rationale is to illustrate the significance of crowdfunding to alternative financing, and how blockchain technology might improve the weaknesses of crowdfunding. The real estate industry needs to embrace new solutions, capable of dealing with its traditional problems and to increase efficiency, sustainability, accountability and prevent market failures within the economy. In this new market environment, we review real estate crowdfunding acceptance in the US, Europe and Asia as well as conceptualize tech-enhanced platform that adopts the blockchain to improve the crowdfunding process for real estate public housing.

To establish the potentials of BCTech in the real estate sector, this study used a systematic review of the literature found in Researchgate, ScienceDirect, Semantic Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and Google searches. This was done with a view to ascertaining the current challenges in real estate practice and the potential benefits of applying BCTech to mitigate or eliminate these challenges. A total of 99 publications from 2016 to 2022 were examined, and their contents were assessed using descriptive statistical tools and presented in charts and tables. Based on the review, BCTech can provide platforms for tokenized ownership, smart contracts, quick transactions and cost reduction. Moreover, the outcome also showed that some countries have applied BCTech to land registration, with a few others to record keeping and real estate tokenization. In addition, the majority of the research efforts (55%) were from journal outlets published between 2020 and 2022. Finally, BCTech offers secure and transparent platforms for real estate stakeholders; hence, they have a lot to gain by encouraging and embracing its adoption.

It is desirable to have high level of model performance in the development of mass real estate valuation models for the development of sustainable real estate management strategies. For this reason, this study aims to develop a comprehensive methodology that increases the performance of mass real estate valuation models by using optimized datasets and clustering geographical value in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) modeling environment. A case study was carried out in Istanbul and Kocaeli provinces covering neighborhoods with different levels of socio-economic-development. This study was carried out using the big data, which was prepared for 121 criteria incorporating approximately 200.000 real estate values. Firstly, datasets were optimized by using the Boxplot technique concerning dataset-based outliers and Cluster and Outlier Analysis techniques were used regarding the location-based outliers. Next, 22 of the criteria affecting the value was determined with Pearson Correlation technique through analyzing the local relationship between real estate value and the criteria. Based on the result of the Spatially Constrained Multivariate Clustering Analysis (SCMCA) analysis, five different geographical value clusters with similar socio-development characteristics were detected. Mass valuation performances were tested covering all study area and these five clustered areas assessed with the use of Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) model were used commonly in developing mass real estate valuation models. The model accuracies were evaluated through performance measurement metrics used in machine learning (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and mass real estate valuation (WtR, COD, PRD) technique that was recommended by IAAO.

The popular instruments of green financing include, green bonds, green loans, equity-based instruments, sustainability-linked loans etc. However, the green investment vehicles face several bottlenecks such as high transaction costs for managing the principal agent relationship, higher minimum sum to be invested, and opportunity costs. The recent popularity of green bonds also leads to high incidences of green washing. Blockchain based tokenized securities can improve transaction efficiency, liquidity, and transparency through better management of intermediaries in the real estate sector. However, they face certain risks such as the regulatory risk, technology risk, and acceptability of the asset class. The objective of this research is to determine whether the blockchain technology has the potential to solve the existing problems of paper-based transactions, high transaction costs, lack of transparency, high costs of property valuation, slow and opaque process, fraudulent transactions, and green washing related to green real estate bonds. The benefits and barriers of tokenizing real estate green bond issuance were also explored. The data sources include in-depth interviews with diverse stakeholders such as developers, subject matter experts including practitioners and academicians, and industry analysts as well as other secondary sources of data. It is found that the blockchain based tokenized securities for green real estate bonds can help in improving liquidity and efficiency of real estate transactions. The transparency is also improved due to disintermediation. The study regarding potential of tokenization is still in its infancy. The interviewed experts also opined that the potential of tokenization has not yet been fully realized because of paucity of technical infrastructures, weak state capacity for regulation, immature asset class, volatilities in the token market, and missing out of an entrepreneurial public sector. The blockchain technology can be used for lowering the cost of intermediation for the issuance of green real estate bonds. Green financing in the real estate sector has been rising recently because of trend towards environmental, social, and corporate governance investing and increased consensus towards a need for carbon neutral construction in the real estate sector. Blockchain technology allows participants to keep maintain a distributed ledger without any control of a central authority. Blockchains can be public and private. The public blockchains are generally immutable as it is open to all the participants, without any censorship, no third-party entity involvement, and it is neutral. The private blockchain on the other hand are open to only authorized participants with governance involving a control of third party.

This paper delves into the environmental and economic implications of smart services for building operations. Drawing from an empirical study conducted in collaboration with a major Swiss real estate company, Implenia, this research investigates the perspectives of property owners, property managers, and consumer tenants regarding smart building services (i.e., tenant platform). Quantitative assessments reveal the potential economic value created through the integration of smart technologies, showcasing increased revenues for property owners while factoring in initial equipment costs and additional rental income. However, the environmental benefits, measured in CO2 equivalents, are found to be less substantial than initially assumed. This study underscores the positive impact of smart building technologies on stakeholders. Despite its preliminary nature, the research offers insights into stakeholder preferences and highlights the potential for future advancements in more sustainable IoT solutions within the real estate industry.

Second, to explore blockchain technology in Dubai, and third, to describe the sustainable aspects generated by blockchain by looking at different projects implemented in Dubai. The paper summarizes several measures for implementing, promoting, and regulating the advancement of blockchain technology taking the example of Dubai. Finance, supply chain, digital identity, energy, healthcare, real estate, transportation, and crowdfunding are only a few industries that have well-embraced blockchain technology. This chapter uses an exploratory approach by reviewing past studies and literature reviews on the topic of blockchain in Dubai.",,,,Contemporary Research in Accounting and Finance,"Abdelghani Echchabi, Rihab Grassa, Welcome Sibanda",,2022-05-29,2022,2022-05-29,2022,,,253-271,Closed,Chapter,"Baroudi, Sarra; Benghida, Sonia","Baroudi, Sarra (Department of Accounting, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK); Benghida, Sonia (Sociology Department, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada)","Baroudi, Sarra (Heriot-Watt University)","Baroudi, Sarra (Heriot-Watt University); Benghida, Sonia (McGill University)",3,3,,1.31,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148241842,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,

1514,pub.1186800471,10.3390/app15063357,,,A Study on Residential Community-Level Housing Vacancy Rate Based on Multi-Source Data: A Case Study of Longquanyi District in Chengdu City,"As a pillar industry of China’s economy, the real estate sector has been challenged by the increasing prevalence of housing vacancies, which negatively impacts market stability. Traditional vacancy rate estimation methods, relying on labor-intensive surveys and lacking official statistical support, are limited in accuracy and scalability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel framework for assessing residential community-level housing vacancy rates through the integration of multi-source data. Its core is based on night-time lighting data, supplemented by other multi-source big data, for housing vacancy rate (HVR) estimation and practical validation. In the case study of Longquanyi District in Chengdu City, the main conclusions are as follows: (1) with low data resolution, the model estimates a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14, which is highly accurate; (2) the average housing vacancy rate (HVR) of houses in Longquanyi District’s residential community is 46%; (3) the HVR rises progressively with the increase in the distance from the city center; (4) the correlation between the HVR of Longquanyi District and the house prices of the area is not obvious; (5) the correlation between the HVR of Longquanyi District and the time of completion of the communities in the region is not obvious, but the newly built communities have extremely high HVR. Compared to the existing literature, this study innovatively leverages multi-source big data to provide a scalable and accurate solution for HVR estimation. The framework enhances understanding of urban real estate dynamics and supports sustainable city development.",,"This research was funded by the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, grant number 18YJC850004;

Along with the marginal diminishing effect of Chinese monetary policies and the increase of the overall leverage ratio, the Chinese economic growth mode of relying on real estate, trade and infrastructure construction in the past will not be sustainable in the next decade. This paper makes a theoretical analysis on the reduction of the search cost in digital economy. Also, this paper used empirical methods to study the relationship between China’s economic growth and digital infrastructure construction. In conclusion, the digital economy has reduced the search cost for people, and big data will become a product factor participating in labor distribution. In addition, this paper proposes for the first time that digital economy can effectively restrain inflation. The Chinese government needs to attach importance to the issue that current internet enterprise oligarchs will probably monopolize the usage of big data in the development of digital economy in the future and become the obstacle to effective economic growth. In addition, close attention should be paid to the vulnerabilities of financial and taxation systems for digital economic entities to avoid continuous disguised tax subsidies to internet oligarchs, thus preventing industrial monopoly.",,,Journal of Infrastructure Policy and Development,,,,2022-04-07,2022,2022-04-07,,6,1,1397,All OA; Gold,Article,"ZHOU, An","ZHOU, An ()",,"ZHOU, An ()",18,18,,9.16,https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/jipd/article/download/1397/1087,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146988559,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics,10 Reduced Inequalities; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Mapping and analysing the plethora of legal implications of rapidly further evolving financial technology have gained momentum. The paper aims to contribute to it. Focus is on the German view. The following questions have inspired the analysis: How might FinTech best be defined and its most important manifestations best be systematized for legal purposes? Have the most pressing legal issues been addressed, so far? The paper considers the legal challenges of FinTech as huge, reaching far beyond financial markets. It argues that artificial intelligence and machine learning deserve utmost attention particularly in this context. The paper postulates that the law – being well-equipped to control the complex, constantly morphing risks of financial innovation while allowing exploiting its benefits – shall not just react to but lead the transformation. The present author considers particularly legal academia responsible for continuously steering and shaping a balanced and objective discourse leading to adequate legal responses in the realm of FinTech. It is time to reassert the crucial role of law in times of deep technological change not only in financial markets.

However, these subjects have been investigated separately, without empirical evidence on the assessment of warehouse features, nor studies matching those with 3PL providers’ needs. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a deeper understanding of the alignment between the 3PL industry’s needs and the logistics real estate offering. An extensive literature review was used to investigate the characteristics of the logistics real estate industry and define the present and future challenges for the 3PL industry.

This modern investment approach leverages blockchain technology to divide property ownership into digital tokens, making real estate assets more accessible to a broader range of investors. Tokenisation facilitates fractional ownership by reducing the financial barriers typically associated with property investments and allowing individuals to acquire portions of valuable real estate assets rather than whole properties. This study investigates the impacts of tokenisation on public access to real estate investments in Brazil and Thailand, highlighting their effects on market growth, investor participation, and economic sustainability. This case study looks at the regulatory frameworks, new market trends, and technological advances in these regions and compares how they were adopted, how far they have come, and the problems that come with that. The researchers seek to determine how tokenisation has influenced real estate investment strategies, reshaped traditional ownership models, and fostered economic inclusion.

Anti-money laundering laws and regulations are crucial to good practices in governance, and they are becoming even more essential now that the use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies raises concerns about possible misconduct facilitated by these new technologies. Amongst alternative assets, this paper focuses specifically on real estate and fine art, which are notably vulnerable to money laundering. Firstly, the paper provides an overview of the key characteristics of these industries, which make them attractive to money launderers. Secondly, it investigates why the misuse of blockchain and cryptocurrencies can facilitate criminal activities, analysing the case of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum smart contract mixer. Finally, a different perspective on blockchain is introduced. The technology has a broader scope and applications beyond cryptocurrencies, and it can represent a valuable resource to increase transparency and promote sustainable finance objectives. Key findings are that blockchain technology can be a double-edged sword for governance and sustainable finance but has great potential to benefit society.

In addition, Governments are increasingly committed to prioritizing energy efficiency initiatives and implementing energy measures to address climate change and its impacts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may allow for precise measurement and optimization of building energy saving, which is yet to be explored. This paper aims to examine the integration of AI in automating the prediction and optimization of energy performance in residential buildings. Unlike the common practices, the scenario development and building optimization tend to be enhanced by using AI in the present paper, using a Python-based script alongside the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) through EnergyPlus simulations. This approach balances multiple objectives, such as energy consumption and thermal comfort, to streamline the identification of optimal building configurations. Seven machine learning (ML) models, including Linear Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and a deep Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) are developed and assessed in predicting three key performance metrics: Energy Use Intensity (EUI), Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD), and Heating Load. A hybrid stacked model, combining FNN with XGB, using GBM meta learner, emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive Coefficient of Determination (R²) of 0.99 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.02 across all targets. This model was trained and validated using simulation data from selected areas of London. It was further evaluated on unseen data from diverse UK cities without retraining, confirming its predictive power across varying climatic conditions. Feature importance analysis revealed that occupant behaviour and infiltration play the most significant role in energy performance, surpassing structural and building envelope characteristics. This paper’s contributions lie in the workflow designed for automating selected tasks, the AI-driven optimization framework, and the robust hybrid modeling approach, offering novel tools for energy-efficient building design and retrofitting. The findings are particularly valuable for architects, urban planners, and policymakers seeking scalable, data-driven solutions to reduce energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Results in Engineering,,,,2025-06,2025,,2025-06,26,,104994,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mehraban, Mohammad H.; Sepasgozar, Samad ME; Ghomimoghadam, Alireza; Zafari, Behrouz","Mehraban, Mohammad H.

This paper discusses how to use blockchain tokens to represent real estate titles. Tokens on the blockchain as a technological concept is the closest solution to the legal concept of titles, because it provides for evidence of ownership and can be transferred from one address to another, while giving exclusive access to such an address to the owner. This paper contains the analysis of the concept of tokens in the context of its applicability to title rights on real estate. There is also a discussion of the outcomes of conducted interviews with professionals in the field of Computer Science, technologies, blockchain and smart contracts. Some critical mismatches were found: tokens are not able to satisfy current demand to manage title rights online. To develop a mature and sustainable electronic system, there are certain issues that need to be addressed: inheritance procedures, litigation, guardianship, delegation of rights and rights of third parties (liens and encumbrances) as well as the legal concept of bundle of rights (possession, disposition, enjoyment, etc.), which requires a strong mathematical model. During the abovementioned interviews, some weaknesses were found in the existing ideas of the use of the blockchain for real estate, mostly related to the undesirable centralization and issues with security. As the result of this research, it is obvious what needs to be developed is the concept of a high-level design of the technology, capable of managing title rights on the blockchain, which includes a three-level mechanism of (1) e-voting, which provides for a democratic implementation of governing algorithms; (2) Smart Laws, as the concept of high level “smart” algorithms that implement (by e-voting) existing laws related to property rights in a form of the program/protocol; and (3) smart contract templates which are based on the smart laws, that allow people to manage their title rights online.","This paper is an outcome of the PhD research performed inside of the Joint International Doctoral (Ph.D.) Degree in Law, Science and Technology, coordinated by the University of Bologna, CIRSFID in cooperation with University of Turin, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Tilburg University, Mykolas Romeris University, The University of Luxembourg.

In the face of the complex and changing market environment and potential financial risks, the establishment of an effective financial risk early warning model has become a key initiative for real estate enterprises to prevent and resolve risks. Taking listed real estate companies in 2018-2023 as the research object, this paper establishes a set of comprehensive and accurate financial risk early warning model by constructing an early warning indicator system containing financial and non-financial indicators, and applying BP (back propagation) neural network algorithm in the field of artificial intelligence. The model takes into full consideration of the financial status of real estate enterprises, operational performance, market environment and other factors, and can effectively capture the potential financial risk signals, providing an important basis for enterprise risk management and decision-making.

The home sales index (HSI) is considered one of the most important factors for forecasting economic trends of housing markets in the real estate and construction industry, and researchers have tried to develop relevant forecasting models for the HSI. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) has generally been used for forecasting future trends based on time series but without investigating any of the influences of social factors. However, there are many demands for effective HSI forecasting by identifying the various social factors influencing the HSI. The HSI can be effectively forecasted in advance by observing several social factors. Such forecasting methods can be developed using big data analytic methods that focus on the relationship between those factors and HSI using web search data. This study suggests a methodology for forecasting model development with the provision of fundamental attributes and the pros and cons of each model to which the multiple regression analysis (MRA) and the artificial neural network (ANN) were applied. The forecasting performance of these models was compared with that by ARIMA. This study also quantifies the HSI forecasting accuracy between MRA and ANN based on social factors obtained from web search data. The forecast HSI values using ARIMA are more accurate than those of MRA and ANN. The lowest mean absolute error and normalized mean-square error for each model were calculated as 1.680 and 1.089 by MRA, 1.557 and 1.843 by ANN, and 0.173 and 0.294 by ARIMA, respectively. This methodology could allow many researchers to create and develop forecasting models using web search data for HSI forecasting and other related economic indexes.",This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and funded by the Ministry of Education of the Korean government (NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058221).

Real estate development plays an important role in shaping urban landscapes, influencing spatial pattern, and socio-economic dynamics. Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), one of the fastest-growing metropolitan regions of India, provides a compelling case for understanding the drivers of real estate-induced urban expansion. This study aims to analyse the drivers of real estate induced urban expansion in Delhi NCR using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP NN) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. A comprehensive dataset comprising of physical, economic, demographic and spatial factors from 1990 to 2021 have been used for the analysis. The MLP NN model has been applied to assess the relative importance of drivers of real estate induced urban expansion in Delhi NCR. The results of MLP NN show that real estate expansion in Delhi NCR is primarily influenced by proximity factors, with the highest importance value of 0.21, observed for distance to regional centres (RC), followed by the distance to major centres (MC) at 0.16, and distance to utility services (US) at 0.14. Population density (0.12) and investment (0.08) also emerged as the main drivers. In contrast, physical factors like slope and elevation had the lowest significance values, 0.003 and 0.004, respectively are less important. The GWR model showed spatial heterogeneity in the influence of these drivers across the districts of Delhi NCR. The model exhibited high explanatory power, with an R2 value of 0.97 alongside an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of 416.49, which shows robustness of the model. This study highlights the significance of considering spatial heterogeneity in urban planning and policy formulation to address the dynamic nature of real estate-induced urban expansion for sustainable urban development.Graphical Abstract",The first author is thankful to University Grant Commission (UGC) for providing doctoral fellowship during this research work.,Not applicable.,Earth Systems and Environment,,,,2025-02-21,2025,2025-02-21,,,,1-17,Closed,Article,"Naikoo, Mohd Waseem; Shahfahad; Talukdar, Swapan; Rihan, Mohd; Ishtiaq, M.; Roy, Shouraseni Sen; Rahman, Atiqur","Naikoo, Mohd Waseem (Department of Geography and Disaster Management, University of Kashmir, 190006, Srinagar, India); Shahfahad (Department of Geography, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, 221005, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India); Talukdar, Swapan (Department of Geography, Asutosh College, University of Calcutta, 700026, Kolkata, West Bengal, India); Rihan, Mohd (Department of Geography, Faculty of Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, 110025, New Delhi, India); Ishtiaq, M.

As the real estate sector is responsible for around 40% of the CO2 emissions, this industry has to carry out additional sustainability reporting and optimisation activities to prove its assets are fulfilling sustainability goals. Most investors concentrate on energy- and CO2 reduction, but ESG is much more. The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations give a perfect overview of the related topics but do not define KPIs. A second challenge is that the market has not honoured the additional tasks by now. Automation is necessary to reduce efforts of the activities The paper provides answers to the following research questions based on several case studies: What are the relevant parameters to prove ESG, focusing especially on the areas of “Environment” and “Social” as parts of the ESG directive? How can an IT support look like to automatise the data gathering efficiently? What is the Return on Investment of the suggested solution?

1231,pub.1172138453,10.15641/jarer.v8i1.1475,,,JARER Editorial Volume 8 (1) of 2023,"Editorial for JARER Vol. 8 Issue 1, 2023 Editorial Welcome to the Volume 8 (2023) Issue 1 edition of the Journal of African Real Estate Research (JARER). The journal remains an exciting platform for the dissemination of scholarships and the different types of applied research engaged within the real estate sector in Africa, and it has continued to grow in leaps and bounds. As reported in the last issue, JARER has been listed in the Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ) since January 2023 and has been recognised as meeting acceptable quality in the three categories (real estate finance, real estate & urban economics and built environment) of the 2021 American Real Estate Society's (ARES) Real Estate Journal List. The list can be found at https://www.aresnet.org/page/journal-list. We want to appreciate the efforts and support of the journal editorial board members, our anonymous reviewers, and other stakeholders, without which these achievements would not be possible. Also, the support we continue to receive from the African Real Estate Society board members, the Library services at the University of Cape Town and the Urban Real Estate Research Unit at the university is appreciated. Our gratitude also goes to the Journal Manager, Ms. Lesedi Kgaka, for her diligent efforts in moving the journal forward.   As usual, the current issue contains thought-provoking and informative topics and is a must-read by everyone who cares to have an understanding of African real estate research and related cities. The first paper, focusing on Lagos, Nigeria, examined the benefits and challenges in the adoption of modern technologies for real estate marketing. The work found that real estate practitioners in Nigeria were yet to fully tap into the unfolding benefits of modern technologies due to a low level of enlightenment and a lack of property data. The paper concluded with the need for practitioners to be enlightened, educated, and trained on the use of various modern technologies for real estate marketing. The second paper, which is an examination of the factors influencing the adoption of automating systems in high-rise buildings in Lagos, Nigeria, found the need to protect buildings against failure as the most significant factor influencing the adoption of automation in the management of facilities in high-rise buildings. The paper concluded that the use of automation in facilities management of high-rise buildings presents facility managers with innovative ways of ensuring the functionality of the built environment. The roles played by various actors in household mobility and the eventual reoccurrence of slums in the city of Kampala, Uganda, amidst the slum upgrading initiatives formed the focus of the third paper. The paper, which adopted a case study approach, found that the influence of slum upgrading actors in the low-income household mobility and reoccurrence of the Namuwongo slum was exhibited through three thematic areas. These are the tracking of the residential mobility tendencies, fit-for-purposes of the upgrading programs and actors' collaboration in the process. The paper's conclusion emphasised the need for actors' collaboration and participation of low-income slum-dwelling households to enable adequate fit-for-purposes of the in-situ upgrading initiatives. Given that access to housing is one of the challenges international students face in universities worldwide, the fourth paper examined housing satisfaction among international students studying at Hong Kong's universities. Using the snowball sampling technique, data was collected from seventy-four international students of six nationalities studying at four universities in Hong Kong. This study highlighted some far-reaching implications for Hong Kong universities, including the need to revisit the issue of accommodation and support provided to international students and an increase in the student housing stock to assist international students. The fifth paper examines Blockchain technology's (BCTech) potential in the real estate sector. To achieve this objective, the paper used a systematic review of the literature found in Researchgate, ScienceDirect, Semantic Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and Google Search. Examining a total of 99 publications from 2016 to 2022, the paper found that BCTech could provide platforms for tokenised ownership, smart contracts, quick transactions and cost reduction and offers secure and transparent platforms for real estate stakeholders. The study concluded that though BCTech is not yet widely used, it has a lot of potential to offer in terms of the sustainability of the real estate industry. I am sure that the JARER will continue to grow from strength to strength in the years to come and contribute to the development of African researchers' activities and endeavours. I look forward to receiving your feedback on this and previous issues of the journal.

1215,pub.1166497292,10.1201/9781003349518-9,,,Developments of 3D Cadastres in the Asian Context,"The development of 3D cadastres in Asia is gradually processing. This chapter describes a number of the latest developments in this domain, based on both academic and grey literature. One the one hand, 3D cadastres are developing in direct connection to the LADM prescriptions. On the other hand, 3D cadastres are de facto emerging indirectly through other application fields, such as urban analytics, disaster management, sustainable energy and real estate management. The recent rise and adoption of object and building models such as cityGML, LADM and BIM are, however, fostering new avenues and opportunities for realising 3D cadastres, also in the Asian contexts. Both the instantaneous contextual nature of data integration as well as the discursive changes in how 3D cadastres are embedded and related to other fields shed a different light on what 3D cadastres actually mean and how one can define, develop, evaluate or embed 3D cadastres conceptually. When, however, 3D cadastres are the indirect result of other applications, the legal information depends on the degree of trust one has in the original data source. Furthermore, the Asian examples in the fields of urban analytics demonstrate the enormous potential uptake of open big data based applications, which may indirectly generate various kinds of interactive and interconnected 3D cadastres.",,,,Geospatial Science for Smart Land Management,,,2023-11-29,2023,2023-11-29,,,,100-106,Closed,Chapter,"de Vries, Walter Timo; Soeksmantono, Budhy; Suwardhi, Deni","de Vries, Walter Timo (); Soeksmantono, Budhy (); Suwardhi, Deni ()",,"de Vries, Walter Timo (); Soeksmantono, Budhy (); Suwardhi, Deni ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166497292,40 Engineering; 4013 Geomatic Engineering; 48 Law and Legal Studies,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities
1213,pub.1171626385,10.3390/en17102310,,,Energy Performance in Residential Buildings as a Property Market Efficiency Driver,"Energy consumption plays an important role in contemporary economies. Its significance extends beyond utilitarian value, impacting economic robustness, environmental protection, and residents’ well-being. The escalating global energy requisites necessitate efficient energy utilization and a shift towards renewable sources to address climate change and strengthen energy independence. Developing accurate predictive models to forecast long-term energy costs and savings remains a complex problem. This paper aims to provide a methodology to identify the influence of building energy performance on real estate market efficiency, focusing on property maintenance costs. Real estate plays a crucial role in human life, serving both as a fundamental need and as a vehicle for achieving personal aspirations and secure financial investments, particularly during times of economic and social instability. Through interdisciplinary methodological architecture, this study addresses three key issues: the impact of rising energy costs on market efficiency, the responsiveness of the real estate market to energy price fluctuations, and the significance of property maintenance costs on market value. The research approach includes creating and applying AI algorithms capable of evaluating extensive datasets pertaining to real estate features. Utilizing machine learning methods, the algorithm determines the importance of energy efficiency measures as well as various other inherent and external attributes of properties.

Although they are primarily recreational in nature, there is potential for them to be catalysts to educate the public on environmental, economic, and social issues connected with urban sustainability, resiliency, and regeneration. Early games were based on a linear (mechanical) approach to urbanism. Today’s computer simulations have various degrees of autonomous systems interactions. As games and simulations evolve in complexity and realism, so too does their ability to mirror more integrated urban systems and explore a wide range of scenario planning alternatives. Future simulations will include more autonomous interaction and eventually artificial intelligence-designed environments.","With much appreciation to Dr. Hidehiko Kanegae, the Japan Association of Simulation and Gaming (JASAG), and the International Simulation and Gaming Association (ISAGA).

1190,pub.1160730222,10.2139/ssrn.4508114,,,The Emperor’s New Clothes or the Next Big Thing? - Web3 Applications in Real Estate Decarbonization,"The building sector’s decarbonization progress made to date has not been enough to achieve the target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C1. To avert a catastrophic climate disaster, mobilizing capital at the requisite scale and speed is urgently needed. However, as things stand, the investment in building decarbonization is unlikely to increase radically in the next few years. One of the biggest challenges is the financial barrier of decarbonization's demand and supply side. This barrier will lead to significant investment gaps and a subsequent market failure to deliver the net zero carbon emission target. With the rise of the voluntary carbon market and carbon data disclosure mandates, an emerging cohort of Web3 startups is helping corporations track, tokenize, and transact energy or carbon impact. This phenomenon inspired us to revisit monetizing carbon value in commercial real estate to bridge the decarbonization financing barrier. We identified four challenges to make this idea work: 1) measurement and verification, 2) streamlined automation, 3) stakeholder incentive alignment, and 4) fixing the failing carbon market. We examine if Web3 decarbonization solutions can tackle those four challenges in monetizing building decarbonization. By looking into Web3 applications in decarbonization data management, tokenization, and marketplace, we unpack the unique capabilities and potentials of Web3 solutions and how they are different from the status quo to accelerate decarbonization in commercial real estate. The findings are a mixture of ""the emperor's new clothes"" and "" the next big thing .""Web3 startups are immature – most are at or before proof of concept. Nonetheless, Web3 technologies can play a role in providing improvements to carbon data management, aligning stakeholders' incentives, and increasing efficiency in the energy or carbon markets.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2023,2023,2023,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Tan, Zhengzhen; Guo, Alice; Arunachalam, Naveen","Tan, Zhengzhen (MIT Center for Real Estate, MIT Sustainable Urbanization Lab); Guo, Alice (Dealversity.ai Inc.); Arunachalam, Naveen (Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT))",,"Tan, Zhengzhen (MIT Center for Real Estate, MIT Sustainable Urbanization Lab); Guo, Alice (Dealversity.ai Inc.); Arunachalam, Naveen (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160730222,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

In particular, the research emphasizes evaluating the effects of Italian Residential Real Estate investments on the three dimensions of sustainability conceptualized through the ESG – Environmental Social Governance criteria. In this context, the authors experiment with identifying a set of indicators according to ESG criteria helpful in describing the incidence of activities in Real Estate processes (along the entire life cycle of the asset) and, therefore, to guide residential market investors in choices with a high sustainable impact. The methodology of this work has firstly identified the European and Italian regulatory framework relating to the ESG sphere by studying the indicators already in use or developed for measuring sustainable performance particularly for real estate sector, like gaps in literature about proper methodologies to measure performance while involving process’ actors. Then, the proposed participatory methodology has been built by taking as reference a real case study – reuse of a building complex in the city of Milan for residential purposes- to identify with a panel of experts and involved actors the phases and sub-phases listed as work-breakdown structure, which may be subject to performance and impact measurement. Furthermore, ESG impacts in terms of beneficiaries from the project and key performance indicators has been assessed and ranked, resulting in an economic and social sustainability criteria priority in involved actors’ sake. Therefore, this research work provides the foundations for a replicable evaluation system for measuring sustainability standards in the residential Real Estate market considering innovatively co-participative decision-making processes along the project life-cycle. However, the methodology can be reinforced in the future with sensitivity methods on involved actors’ primary choices in the multi-criteria process and the enlargement of Panel experts’ profiles or, even, addressed to other targets more than the residential one. Il presente articolo si ispira a recenti ricerche e studi sui modelli di investimento nel settore immobiliare promossi dalle nuove politiche e dai programmi d’azione dell’Unione Europea e, principalmente, dai diciassette Obiettivi di Sviluppo Sostenibile – OSS – dell’Agenda 2030. In particolare, la ricerca si concentra sulla valutazione della sostenibilità delle scelte progettuali secondo le tre dimensioni (ambientale, economica e sociale) concettualizzate nei criteri ESG – Environmental Social Governance. In questo contesto, gli autori sperimentano l’identificazione di un set di indicatori derivati dai criteri ESG utili agli operatori del mercato immobiliare nella scelta di soluzioni progettuali sostenibili. In una prima fase lo studio ha analizzato il quadro normativo europeo e italiano relativo ai criteri ESG, analizzando quali sono gli indicatori definiti per la misurazione delle performance di sostenibilità e come questi si possono applicare in ambito immobiliare. Successivamente, prendendo a riferimento un caso di studio reale relativo al recupero – a fini residenziali – di un complesso edilizio a Milano – è stato selezionato un Panel di esperti e di attori coinvolti nel progetto al quale è stato chiesto di indicare quali sono gli aspetti e i criteri significativi per operare scelte sostenibili e di determinarne l’importanza (peso). L’obiettivo è quello di definire un sistema di valutazione della sostenibilità degli interventi in ambito immobiliare, con particolare riferimento al segmento residenziale, considerando gli effetti generati dalle scelte progettuali lungo tutto il ciclo di vita del progetto, dalla fase di ideazione a quella di costruzione e gestione. I risultati ottenuti evidenziano che gli aspetti di sostenibilità maggiormente significativi sono quelli legati alla sostenibilità economica e al benessere degli utenti e dei fruitori dell’intervento; l’applicabilità della metodologia – e la significatività dei risultati – dovranno essere ulteriormente verificati attraverso l’ampliamento dei profili dei componenti del Panel di esperti e la sperimentazione su altre tipologie di intervento e di destinazioni d’uso.",,,Valori e Valutazioni,,,,2023-07,2023,,,33,,65-84,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cadamuro Morgante, Federica; Gholamzadehmir, Maryam; Sdino, Leopoldo; Rosasco, Paolo","Cadamuro Morgante, Federica (Department of Architecture and Urban Studies (DAStU), Politecnico di Milano, via Bonardi 3, Milan, 2); Gholamzadehmir, Maryam (Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (ABC), Politecnico di Mil); Sdino, Leopoldo (Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (ABC), Politecnico di Mi); Rosasco, Paolo (Department Architecture and Design (dAD), University of Genoa, Stradone S.

It is essentially an often decentralized, distributed, peer-to-peer database that is maintained by a network of computers instead of a single entity, making it highly resistant to hacking and data breaches. By providing greater security, transparency and efficiency, blockchain technology can help to create a more equitable and sustainable world. Blockchain technology has the potential to help mankind in various ways, some of which include but are not limited to: Decentralization and Transparency: Blockchain technology allows for decentralization of data and transactions, making them more transparent and accountable. This is particularly important in fields such as finance, where trust and transparency are critical. Increased Security: Blockchain technology is inherently secure due to its distributed nature, making it very difficult for hackers to compromise the system. This makes it an ideal solution for data and information storage, particularly in areas such as health and finance, where privacy and security are of utmost importance. Faster Transactions: Blockchain technology eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing the time and cost associated with transactions. This makes it an ideal solution for international trade, remittances and other types of financial transactions, especially in parts of the world where a great number of individuals do not have access to basic banking services. Immutable Record: One of the fundamental attributes of blockchain is its immutability. Once data is added to the blockchain, it becomes nearly impossible to alter or delete. This feature ensures a tamper-resistant and reliable record of transactions, crucial for maintaining integrity in various industries, including supply chain management and legal documentation. Smart Contracts: Blockchain technology supports the implementation of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. This automation streamlines processes and reduces the risk of fraud, particularly in sectors like real estate and legal agreements. Interoperability: Blockchain’s ability to facilitate interoperability allows different blockchain networks to communicate and share information seamlessly. This attribute is pivotal for creating a unified and interconnected ecosystem, especially as various industries adopt blockchain independently. Interoperability enhances efficiency, reduces redundancy and fosters collaboration across diverse sectors. Leveraging Blockchain Technology: Governance, Risk, Compliance, Security, and Benevolent Use Cases discusses various Governance, Risk and Control (GRC) and operational risk-related considerations in a comprehensive, yet non-technical, way to enable business leaders, managers and professionals to better understand and appreciate its various potential use cases. This book is also a must-read for leaders of non-profit organization, allowing them to further democratize needs that we often take for granted in developed countries around the globe, such as access to basic telemedicine, identity management and banking services.

This study explores how blockchain-enabled asset tokenization influences transaction efficiency, value creation, and risk distribution across different market contexts. Utilizing a multiple-case study design, this research analyzes four asset tokenization business cases in multiple sectors —real estate, gold, gaming assets, and carbon credits—through 30 semi-structured interviews with participants from each case. Our research findings indicate that while tokenization significantly enhances transaction efficiency and creates new value propositions, it also introduces complexities in governance and risk distribution, which may challenge market stability. This study contributes to the contemporary blockchain literature by empirically illustrating how asset tokenization alters traditional asset management and investment models, highlighting the importance of tailored regulatory frameworks to address this emerging blockchain-enabled business models.

Given the rapid and large expected increase in India's building stock over the next 20 or more years, the opportunity exists to make significant increases in overall energy efficiency and reduce energy demand through the application of its Energy Conservation Building Code that influences the design, construction and operation of buildings. However, the responsibility for this code resides with local authorities (urban local bodies) that currently lack sufficient incentive to implement and enforce it. To overcome this impediment, it is argued here that important benefits can be captured by local authorities to implement energy-conservation measures: increased revenues from taxes, improved attractiveness to business and citizens, and the introduction of automation to reduce transaction costs in the building-approval process. Large parts of the country's property (real estate) are yet to be built, providing a valuable opportunity to transition to low-energy and climate-friendly solutions in India's rapidly growing building stock.",,,Building Research & Information,,,,2018-09-20,2018,2018-09-20,2019-01-02,47,1,123-126,Closed,Article,"Mathur, Ajay","Mathur, Ajay (Director General, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), Delhi, India)","Mathur, Ajay (Energy and Resources Institute)","Mathur, Ajay (Energy and Resources Institute)",5,1,,1.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107130158,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 3302 Building,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This has left the municipal corporations that own the public spaces, facilities and infrastructures, mainly green areas and roads, with a legacy that influences and limits their management capacity, due to their duty of conservation and their high operating cost. Given the current situation of the electricity market and the increasingly demanding environmental regulations, the tendency of public administrations is to find a solution to the high emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and light pollution, which in turn can reduce maintenance costs and electricity bills. Due to the great potential of LED technologies and electronic equipment for their regulating capacity, telemanagement and long lifespan, a digital transformation of the public lighting of a couple of urban areas in a small coastal city in southern Spain is performed. First, the implementation of measures to remotely manage them for decreasing energy consumption and pollution levels is analyzed. Then, the amortization of necessary investments is studied.

By offering standardized information on a property’s energy use, it shapes buyer and tenant preferences, influencing property values. This data-driven policy analysis assesses the EPC's effectiveness. To assess the impact of EPC on property prices in Turin, Italy, a comprehensive machine learning (ML) framework is employed. This framework includes unsupervised hierarchical clustering and supervised algorithms including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). These techniques facilitate an in-depth analysis of the complex relationships between EPC ratings and property prices. Furthermore, the integration of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) enhances the transparency of these models, providing clear insights into how EPC ratings affect prices across different property sub-markets. By demystifying the decision-making processes of complex algorithms, this approach makes the findings more accessible to stakeholders. The flexibility of this framework suggests that it can be applied to other European contexts, offering a valuable tool for policymakers aiming to craft more effective energy efficiency strategies.","Declaration of competing interest The author declares the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Federico Dell’Anna reports administrative support, article publishing charges, equipment, and writing assistance were provided by Politecnico di Torino.",,Energy Policy,,,,2025-03,2025,,2025-03,198,,114407,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Dell’Anna, Federico","Dell’Anna, Federico (Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning (DIST), Politecnico di Torino, Viale Mattioli 39, 10125, Turin, Italy)",,"Dell’Anna, Federico (Polytechnic University of Turin)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2024.114407,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1183273610,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4802 Environmental and Resources Law,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

A participant of the Gaidar Forum - 2021 Recent development trends are formed under the influence of multiple factors. They move in different directions and make completely unexpected turns, adjusting standard settings and expectations of the population. Meanwhile, the rap­id development of anthropology, futurology, information modeling against the background of the effective and timely implementation of state support measures, international community's efforts to promote valuation technologies of sus­tainable development, the expansion of “green” financing and the demand to impose social responsibility on large busi­nesses allows to assume that all sectors of the national economy, including real estate and construction, will be ex­posed not only to digital transformation, technological upgrade, institutional and socio-economic reboot, but also to the re-evaluation of efficiency criteria of business models. In this regard, the implementation of the requirements of the Na­tional Project “Housing and Urban Environment” is complicated not only due to the budget constraints, the decline in production, the outflow of migrants due to the pandemic, but also due to the need to significantly reconsider the mod­el of economic development. It is necessary to restructure not only the industrial and infrastructure framework of capital funds, but also to develop fundamentally new approaches to the management of the life cycle of real estate. The grow­ing singularity of economic processes forces us to make flexible decisions and create different types of real estate with regard for emerging cultural and anthropological preferences.

Traditional housing price models overlook spatial nuances, focusing solely on structural attributes. To address this, we constructed valuation models using ordinary least square regression and Fast Geographic Weighted Regression (FastGWR), implemented through Python and MPI, based on spatial variables. The models explained up to 75 percent of variance in Faisalabad and around 85 percent in Lahore. Factors like floor area, proximity of health facilities, recreational sites, and marketplaces add a premium to prices, while the nearness of educational institutions, worship places, and solid waste transfer stations or dumping sites lessen the property values in both cities. However, the proximity of industrial units and graveyards affects property values negatively in Lahore but positively in Faisalabad. This study highlights the critical significance of spatial factors in urban immovable property appraisal. As a result, it is recommended to integrate these factors into the process of policy formulation and urban planning.
 1. INTRODUCTION
 Pakistan’s real estate market emerges as a potential economic powerhouse, with a substantial portion of the nation’s wealth concentrated within its real estate assets, estimated at 60-70 percent. While the sector contributes around 2 percent to the GDP, the combined impact of housing and construction reaches nearly 9 percent. The value of Pakistan’s real estate sector, evaluated at approximately $700 billion by the Federal Board of Revenue, signifies its economic significance. Impressively, returns on investment can soar beyond 100 percent (Ouattara et al., 2018). However, this promising market is juxtaposed against a backdrop of challenges and disparities. Pakistan’s population, surpassing 225 million, expands annually at a 2.4 percent rate, characterised by an average household size of 6.5 (Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, 2019). With a yearly housing requirement of 700,000 units, merely half of this demand is met, leading to an alarming gap of roughly 10 million units (Rizvi, 2018). This housing shortage necessitates innovative strategies, particularly in the realm of low-cost housing schemes. The intricacies of property valuation further complicate the real estate landscape. Government land acquisitions relying on DC valuation tables often incite public protests due to perceived undervaluation (Sabir et al., 2017).

Traditional housing price models overlook spatial nuances, focusing solely on structural attributes. To address this, we constructed valuation models using ordinary least square regression and Fast Geographic Weighted Regression (FastGWR), implemented through Python and MPI, based on spatial variables. The models explained up to 75 percent of variance in Faisalabad and around 85 percent in Lahore. Factors like floor area, proximity of health facilities, recreational sites, and marketplaces add a premium to prices, while the nearness of educational institutions, worship places, and solid waste transfer stations or dumping sites lessen the property values in both cities. However, the proximity of industrial units and graveyards affects property values negatively in Lahore but positively in Faisalabad. This study highlights the critical significance of spatial factors in urban immovable property appraisal. As a result, it is recommended to integrate these factors into the process of policy formulation and urban planning.
 1. INTRODUCTION
 Pakistan’s real estate market emerges as a potential economic powerhouse, with a substantial portion of the nation’s wealth concentrated within its real estate assets, estimated at 60-70 percent. While the sector contributes around 2 percent to the GDP, the combined impact of housing and construction reaches nearly 9 percent. The value of Pakistan’s real estate sector, evaluated at approximately $700 billion by the Federal Board of Revenue, signifies its economic significance. Impressively, returns on investment can soar beyond 100 percent (Ouattara et al., 2018). However, this promising market is juxtaposed against a backdrop of challenges and disparities. Pakistan’s population, surpassing 225 million, expands annually at a 2.4 percent rate, characterised by an average household size of 6.5 (Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, 2019). With a yearly housing requirement of 700,000 units, merely half of this demand is met, leading to an alarming gap of roughly 10 million units (Rizvi, 2018). This housing shortage necessitates innovative strategies, particularly in the realm of low-cost housing schemes. The intricacies of property valuation further complicate the real estate landscape. Government land acquisitions relying on DC valuation tables often incite public protests due to perceived undervaluation (Sabir et al., 2017). The importance of precise valuation for equitable compensation is underscored by research (Malaitham et al., 2020). Notably, property valuation is not just pivotal for buyers and sellers; it resonates with stakeholders such as investors, banks, agents, and insurers. The geographical location holds substantial influence over a property’s price, further emphasising the necessity for accurate valuation (Mankad, 2021).

In the course of digitization in the construction industry, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a promising solution for this, which can be used to link product information with a 3D data model, among other things. In Germany, the building trade plays a central role in the creation of building documentation. Efficient and sustainable building documentation contributes to the achievement of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, making documentation even more important. In the course of this, the topic of sustainability in the construction industry is assigned greater importance, as concrete templates must also be created for the documentation and evaluation of construction products from a sustainable point of view. As part of the research project ""BIM Use Cases in the Building Trade"", templates for creating building documentation are being developed in collaboration between the BIM Institute at the University of Wuppertal, the Fraunhofer Institute for Factory Operation and Automation IFF and a total of 14 practice partners. These can then be used by public clients as a basis for client information requirements.

1106,pub.1171215291,10.31893/multirev.2024107,,,Blockchain auditing dilemma: Exploring hesitation among audit firms,"Blockchain technology, initially developed for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has expanded its reach into various sectors, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and real estate. The technology's transparency, and security have led many to view it as self-auditing. On the other hand, as blockchain integrates into traditional business models, the necessity for formal auditing processes akin to those in the nonblockchain corporate (business) world becomes evident and highly important. The present research explores the hesitancy among audit firms (statutory auditors) to engage in blockchain auditing, delving into the technological, regulatory, and inherent risks that make blockchain a challenging terrain for auditors and their work. The present research outlines the evolution of the blockchain environment, detailing its historical progression and diverse platforms. This finding underscores the crucial role of auditing in ensuring transparency, trust, and corporate (business) sustainability. The challenges faced by audit firms in the blockchain space, including technical complexities, regulatory ambiguities, and inherent risks such as cryptocurrency market volatility/risk, are extensively discussed. Practical case studies such as those of DAO attack, QuadrigaCX's missing funds, and the scrutiny of Bitfinex and Tether illustrate the consequences of inadequate auditing in blockchain platforms. Potential solutions for these challenges have been put forth, with an emphasis on the following: collaborative learning and training, advocacy for regulatory clarity, technological advancements, and the development of auditing standards specific to blockchain. The study culminates by emphasising the consequences of audit firms' ongoing reluctance towards blockchain technology and the advantages that can be gained by surmounting these obstacles. The aforementioned discovery implies that a mutually beneficial association between auditors and the blockchain industry may usher in an unprecedented epoch characterised by enhanced market economy transparency, confidence, and ingenuity.

This requires input from the fields of control theory, knowledge-based and reasoning systems, and software architecture. Section 2.3 discusses robots and machine intelligence/artificial intelligence (AI). It argues that the ultimate AI will be a recreation of the human thought process, a man-made machine with intellectual abilities, including the ability to learn, reason, use language, and formulate original ideas. Today’s AI machines can replicate some specific elements of intellectual ability but not all. Finally, Sections 2.4 and 2.5 analyze the programming and autonomous robot algorithm. The emphasis in the development of autonomous field robots is currently on speed, energy efficiency, sensors for guidance, guidance accuracy, and technologies such as wireless communication and Global Positioning System. Compared to other flying vehicles and satellite remote sensing technology, UAVs have two advantages when capturing aerial photographs: low cost and high mobility. A robotic brain cannot operate in isolation. It needs sensory inputs, and it must produce motor output to influence objects in the environment. Thus, the main challenge in contemporary robotics is the development of robotic brains. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are already being explored as useful tools in multiple civil scenarios. In many cases, UAV-based systems are required for surveillance and reconnaissance, monitoring, mapping and photogrammetry, automatic fault detection, or inventory tasks. Drones are starting to be applied in many other inspection scenarios, such as power lines, levees and embankments, confined spaces, ecology, wind turbines, cranes, and real estate.",,,,"Robots, Drones, UAVs and UGVs for Operation and Maintenance",,,2020-05-07,2020,2020-05-07,2020-05-07,,,37-72,Closed,Chapter,"Galar, Diego; Kumar, Uday; Seneviratne, Dammika","Galar, Diego (); Kumar, Uday (); Seneviratne, Dammika ()",,"Galar, Diego (); Kumar, Uday (); Seneviratne, Dammika ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127464727,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4608 Human-Centred Computing; 4612 Software Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The foregoing raises significant economic psychology and policy-making questions about the causes and measurement of cross-border spillovers (from developed countries to emerging markets), and evolving relationships among cross-border spillovers, legal/regulatory institutions, foreign aid, political systems, government size, social-welfare, fintech-platforms, asset-market dynamics (volatility, market-depth, liquidity, pension/retirement, remittances, business/consumer confidence; etc.) and sustainable growth. This book is the first of two volumes, re-defines geopolitical risk and addresses these issues in the context of the role of constitutional economics and economic psychology (especially households and companies) as tools for global sustainable growth and risk management. This book can help researchers develop better Artificial Intelligence, Complex Systems and decision-theory models of geopolitical risk, public policy, asset-pricing, global corporate strategy and international capital flows, all of which are increasingly relevant to investment managers, corporate executives, boards-of-directors and government officials.

This process had a significant impact on governance and led to a paradigm shift in public administration.
Today, effective public administration is unthinkable without e-governance. E-governance is a tool for sustainable development of public administration, ensuring the transformation of public administration through the use of modern digital technological innovations.
The introduction of innovative e-governance solutions based on digital technologies is a serious problem for the country, both at the central and local levels. The article examines the global technological innovation - blockchain, analyzes the problems, advantages and disadvantages of its implementation, which is important for the formation of electronic governance as a new form of government.
Internal and external factors influencing the development of e-governance in Georgia using blockchain technology are proposed. Internal factors - associated with an in-depth study of the blockchain system from a technological point of view. The biggest challenge in implementing a technology is realizing its real potential. In this regard, let us single out the architecture of technology and the problem of information security. External Factors - refers to the study of areas and issues that blockchain technology will affect. In this regard, let us highlight the issue of legal regulation. 
Georgia is one of the first countries in the world to implement blockchain technology. The technology was originally used to register real estate. In July 2020, a study was conducted by the National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) to identify the advantages and disadvantages of using blockchain in this area. The research results are described in detail in the article.
We believe that the introduction of blockchain into e-governance in Georgia gives us the opportunity to reduce bureaucracy, budget spending, corruption risks, improve the efficiency of public administration, and this is a prerequisite for taking a worthy place among innovative states.

Following S-D logic, resource integration that results in customer value is dependent on institutions and institutional arrangements. S-D logic’s fifth axiom states: “Value co-creation is coordinated through actor-generated institutions and institutional arrangements” (Vargo & Lusch, 2016, page 18). We report on three case study findings to offer contextualized explanations that seek to join current conceptualizations with solid explanatory power. These cases span from the digitalization of music industry, sustainable strategies in the real estate industry, and insights from an innovation lab for open innovations. The empirical renderings are utilized to help to explain the institutional arrangements that are at play. The results show that the potential boundaries of, how, and which resources can be utilized and integrated are to great extent related to the perceived available “solution space” (von Hippel, 2001) or “opportunity space” (Normann, 2001) offered by the institutional and practice-related boundaries of the context (Ridell, Röndell, & Sörhammar, 2012). By integrating the ideas of a solution space and opportunity space with the later rendering of institutional arrangements as denominator for value creation, we contribute to the current mid-range theory development of S-D logic as well as a better understanding of value co-creation in practice. The introduced concept of institutional solution space combines the idiosyncratic needs of actors with the perceived – i.e., institutional and socio-material-derived – opportunities associated with resources. Thus, it offers a bridge between the abstract concepts of resource integration, value-in-context, and institutional arrangements (Vargo & Lusch, 2016).",,,Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,Back to the Future: Using Marketing Basics to Provide Customer Value,"Nina Krey, Patricia Rossi",,2017-12-06,2017,2017-12-06,2018,,,495-496,Closed,Chapter,"Ekman, Peter; Jonas, Julia; Maglio, Paul; Reynolds, David; Röndell, Jimmie","Ekman, Peter (Mälardalen University, Västerås, Sweden); Jonas, Julia (Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen, Germany); Maglio, Paul (University of California, Merced, CA, USA); Reynolds, David (Warwick University, Coventry, UK); Röndell, Jimmie (Mälardalen University, Västerås, Sweden)","Ekman, Peter (Mälardalen University)","Ekman, Peter (Mälardalen University); Jonas, Julia (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg); Maglio, Paul (University of California, Merced); Reynolds, David (University of Warwick); Röndell, Jimmie (Mälardalen University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093154606,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

                    The predictive accuracy and reliability of artificial intelligence models, such as the artificial neural network (ANN), has led to its application in property valuation studies. However, a large percentage of such previous studies have focused on the property markets in developed economies, and at the same time, effort has not been put into documenting its research trend in the real estate domain. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the studies that adopted ANN for property valuation in order to present an application guide for researchers and practitioners, and also establish the trend in this research area.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Relevant articles were retrieved from online databases and search engines and were systematically analyzed. First, the background, the construction and the strengths and weaknesses of the technique were highlighted. In addition, the trend in this research area was established in terms of the country of origin of the articles, the year of publication, the affiliations of the authors, the sample size of the data, the number of the variables used to develop the models, the training and testing ratio, the model architecture and the software used to develop the models.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The analysis of the retrieved articles shows that the first study that applied ANN in property valuation was published in 1991. Thereafter, the technique received more attention from 2000. While a quarter of the articles reviewed emanated from the USA, the rest were conducted in mostly developed countries. Most of the studies were conducted by universities scholars, while very few industry practitioners participated in the research works. Also, the predictive accuracy of the ANN technique was reported in most of the papers reviewed, but a few reported otherwise.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The articles that are not indexed in the search engines and databases searched and also not available in the public domain might not have been captured in this study.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The findings of this study reveal a gap between the valuation practice in developed and developing property markets and also the contributions of real estate practitioners and universities scholars to real estate research. A paradigm shift in the valuation practice in developing nations could lead to achieving a sustainable international valuation practice.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    This paper presents the trend in this research area that could be useful to real estate researchers and practitioners in different property markets around the world. The findings of this study could also encourage collaboration between industry professionals and researchers domiciled in both developed and developing countries.","The authors sincerely acknowledge the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (SAR) and the Department of Building and Real Estate, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong for providing financial and material support toward this research.

All this changes the very way the foundations of digital exchange and storage were thought about: decentralized, transparent, immutable, the very fundamentals of Distributed Ledger Technology enabling safe data exchange without an intermediary. The blockchain is fundamentally a chain of blocks carrying information about transactions, including times and cryptographic hashes, each of these connecting to the previous one in one unbroken chain, for which no modification is viable. The whole design of Blockchain has been to solve a number of issues, including double spending, fraud, and inefficient records, with distributed nodes and consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, facilitated by cryptographic keys. Other areas beyond cryptocurrency where quite a number of innovative uses are cut across include supply chain, healthcare, financial, and real estate sectors. For example, while the supply chain process is being promoted to become effective and transparent in order to ensure the origin and quality of the product, adding to the guarantee that the user's personal health information will not be accessed and tampered with, blockchain uses smart contracts in automating agreement processes within the contract. All of them are expecting cost reduction, operating efficiencies enhancement, enhanced securities of many industries. Anyhow, there exist quite a number of serious obstacles standing in the way of the wide application of blockchain technology. Firstly, the problem of scalability has still been an issue whereby the network performance tends to be problematic when users are increased. Besides, energy wasting cannot be ignored-apparently mostly a challenge from the PoW kind of system proved to be consuming too much energy, standing big on the road to sustainability. Of course, the mere lack of any kind of international rules and standards is already a complication in making them work. It also underlines failures in the adoption of the system or in decentralizing and is still an open technical and organizational challenge on how to combine blockchain with traditional structures. Their solutions require compounding ideas: sharding of blockchain to make it big, off-chain solutions for the blockchain to be many but thin, and provision of amicable solution consensus mechanisms for environmental conservation. Besides coherent policy vision, in addition to the existing cornerstones of regulation besides well-laid-out standards of interoperability, it is important to create confidence and give a road map across different industries. This paper hereby conceptually reviews the literature with respect to how the blockchain technology was designed to show revolutionary capability in the different fields and what keeps on tormenting it with its future.KEYS: Blockchain technology; Distributed Ledger; Decentralization; Cryptographic keys; Consensus mechanisms; Proof of Work; Proof of Stake; Smart contracts; Supply chain management; Data immutability; Transparency; Scalability; Energy consumption; Challenges to regulatory bodies; Security vulnerability; Sharding; off- chain processing; Interoperability; Applications using blockchain; Architecture of blockchain.",,,Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education (TURCOMAT),,,,2018-12-17,2018,2018-12-17,,9,3,,Closed,Article,"Kacheru, Goutham","Kacheru, Goutham ()",,"Kacheru, Goutham ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1184136441,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Despite early skepticism and regulatory challenges, DAOs have evolved into various forms, particularly Investment DAOs, which facilitate pooled asset management and democratize investment opportunities across sectors such as Web3 and real estate tokenization. Given this evolution, a comprehensive financial framework is urgently needed to address the specific governance structures of DAOs. Traditional financial metrics like the Current Ratio, Cash Flow Management, and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) must be adapted to the unique dynamics of decentralized organizations, promoting a deeper understanding of financial health and operational efficiency while ensuring transparency and accountability. As DAOs now manage treasuries exceeding $40 billion, robust financial oversight is essential. Integrating traditional accounting principles with blockchain’s transparency can revolutionize financial reporting, risk management, and governance, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and fostering trust and collaboration within the DAO ecosystem. This fusion of accounting methods and technology will not only enhance internal governance but also ensure sustainable growth. In conclusion, the increasing prominence of DAOs within the financial landscape highlights the need for forward-looking financial structures that blend established accounting practices with cutting-edge technological solutions, ensuring their continued success in a rapidly changing environment.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2024,2024,2024,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Di Terlizzi, Rocco Francesco Vittorio","Di Terlizzi, Rocco Francesco Vittorio (Link Campus University)",,"Di Terlizzi, Rocco Francesco Vittorio (Link Campus University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1183656600,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Originating from a standard dedicated to design (BS 1192:2007) and although its concept has been extended to information management in general: Capex (strategy, project, construction: PAS 1192-2) and Opex (exercise: PAS 1192-3), the CDE, as it is understood today in common practice, is still very much affected by the original link with the design and the design phase (and in particular the design in the new building). All this according to an information flow that is still very linear and sequential: client, designer, builder, manager, user; more than circular, as the so-called BIM methodology would like. The risk, therefore, is that the commercial software market is affected by this CDE approach, which is also useful for the very rich real estate market of the emerging economies, neglecting the construction market of the more consolidated economies (Europe for before), very built up, and aimed more at housing quality, sustainability, reuse, and renewal of the existing heritage rather than the new one. It is consequently necessary to define new information flows and a new type of information management environment (CDE) for the phases of use, conservation, and renovation of buildings for the European market. The need arises for a specific BIM Management System (BIMMS, overcoming the classic CDE) for asset management and their enhancement that collects information from the buildings themselves and its users (Digital Twins, IoT, sensors, etc.).

This issue is coming as the first regular issue of 2021. The journal's first issue gave way for the Special Issue published in June 2021. For this reason, we want to apologize to the authors whose papers were accepted earlier in the year for the delay in publication. To forestall this situation in the future, the JARER management team has decided to start publishing individual papers in digital format on our website once accepted and while waiting to be published with a full issue at the appointed time.    Karen Gibler and Geci Karuri-Sebina's diligent and painstaking efforts in supporting the journal with the successful publication of the special issue titled: Women in African Real Estate and Urban Development Research are highly appreciated. Our gratitude also goes to the journal editorial board members and the anonymous reviewers, who have been supporting and inspiring the management team, making it possible for us to improve the rate of submissions. We appreciate the continued support of the African Real Estate Society board members. Similarly, we appreciate the constant support we receive from the team and colleagues at the Library Services for the University of Cape Town, South Africa. We like to put on record the assiduous efforts of our former managing editor - Mr Luke Boyle - whose diligence and teamwork we so much enjoyed, and as he heads on to other endeavours in his life, we wish him the best. The untiring efforts of our new managing editor - Ms Lesedi Kgaka - with a view to moving the journal's operation forward and onto the next level are highly appreciated. Our thanks go to Prof. Karl-Werner Schulte and his team from the IREBS at Regensburg University, the IRES, ERES, from whom JARER continues to receive strong support. The current issue contains seven papers focusing on a wide range of topics covering diverse areas of interest in gender differential in real estate entrepreneurship, integrated rural development, housing affordability, indoor environmental quality, tenure security, resource utilization and automation in valuation.  The first paper's focus is on the potential of integrated rural development schemes for improving rural housing infrastructure. A case study of the Rural Development Programme (RUDEP) of Justice Development and Peace Makers' Centre (JDPMC), a non-governmental organization in Osun State, Nigeria, was conducted. The findings led to the conclusion that the RUDEP integrated scheme could be a viable policy option for improving the condition of rural housing in Nigeria.     The second paper takes a holistic view of the housing affordability problem in Africa. It considered the multifaceted nature of the problem vis-à-vis the political, social, institutional, economic and financial milieu of Africa. The paper concluded that the enormity of the problem of housing affordability in Africa is a function of, among others, the vested interest of the power brokers who were profiting from it, the market, the unwitting application of western models to Africa, poverty, and the sheer neglect by the housing policymakers of Africa of the time-tested African means of affordable housing delivery. The apparent domination of the real estate business environment by the male gender and the entrepreneurial intentions of men and women in the real estate sector are the concerns of the third paper from Nigeria. The paper studied the intentions of real estate students at three Nigerian universities to understand better barriers and supporters that shape students' entrepreneurial intentions. In doing this, the paper showed how gendered differences might impact students' entrepreneurial aspirations. The conclusion suggests gender-based differences in the entrepreneurial aspirations of real estate students in Nigeria. The fourth paper evaluated the Nigerian Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) intervention projects and space utilization in Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic (NUBAPOLY), Zaria, Kaduna state, Nigeria. The results revealed that the construction of new buildings and laboratory equipment and furniture provided the main focus of TETFund intervention projects. At the same time, the overall space utilization for NUBAPOLY stood at 43.60%. The paper recommended that TETFund ensure adequate utilization of its intervention projects through supervision and inspection. At the same time, the management of Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic should make optimum utilization of TETFund intervention projects.  The fifth paper examines property valuers' perceptions of the adoption of automated valuation models (AVM) in rating valuation against the use of traditional valuation methods in Malawi. The findings showed that the general perception of Malawi's valuers towards AVM was mixed. While one school of thought gave AVM the benefit of the doubt for future incorporation into the profession if modified to suit the local environment, the other hand considered AVM a threat to the valuation profession since anyone may be deemed qualified to carry out property valuation. The conclusion was that AVM could be adopted as a supplement to the traditional valuation methods but not a replacement. The problem of land tenure security with a view to promoting and motivating land-based investment has been the focus of many countries and development partners and calls for a continuous effort at addressing this critical issue. This is the focus of the sixth paper. The paper explored the factors affecting tenure security for legal landholders in Bahir Dar City in Ethiopia. The results suggest that the perception of landholders about land tenure security was low, with consequences of disinvestment and lack of confidence of ownership on the land and property held in the city and fear of expropriation or involuntary relocation. The seventh paper is a literature review of research methods that seek to establish the measurement of individual productivity and organizational performance in office buildings containing enhanced green building features and initiatives that specifically focus on indoor environmental quality (IEQ). The paper used the PRISMA framework and included thirty-nine academic papers from 2000 to 2020 to discuss different research instruments such as post-occupancy evaluations (POE), longitudinal surveys, and interviews. The key findings highlighted that previous research measured individual productivity via self-assessment. At the same time, no research had successfully measured organizational performance within the context of green building features and initiatives.  Our sincere hope that you will find the papers in this issue of the Journal of African Real Estate Research interesting, thought-provoking, and informative. We appreciate and encourage feedback from readers on their views of this and previous issues of the journal.

The construction industry, which is a kind of multiplier of living standards and economic development, must be provided with innovative technologies. The high quality of finished buildings plays a determinate role in defining the comfort and livability of properties, serving as key benchmarks for assessing real estate values per capita. Similarly, the development of commercial facilities holds significant sway over entrepreneurial activity and industrial infrastructure. These elements serve as barometers of a country’s economic growth and its competitiveness on both domestic and international scales. The introduction of information technology involves automated design, automation of operational processes directly during the construction and commissioning of the object, digitalization of management processes, and further maintenance of property already in operation. This chapter considers the principles of construction of automated design acceptance systems, which include visualization and automation of calculations in order to increase their accuracy and reliability. Mathematical modeling through the use of automated systems is performed in terms of practical engineering tasks, which allows an increase in accuracy of their quantitative estimates and qualitative characteristics. This is paramount when calculating building structures using modern software to provide design automation. The chapter is central to the postwar reconstruction of Ukraine, as it provides an overview of the software used in construction and analyzes specific projects that have provided solutions to complex engineering and architectural problems throughout the country. As such, the utilized application holds immense potential for aiding the country’s recovery once hostilities have ceased.",,,Contributions to Economics,Handbook on Post-War Reconstruction and Development Economics of Ukraine,Giuseppe T.

935,pub.1141845976,10.1360/tb-2020-1536,,,Flood risk dynamics and adaptation analyses for coastal cities based on internet big data and hydrology-hydrodynamic models,"Climate change, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and rapid urbanization are likely to increase flood risk in low-lying coastal cities in the future, posing serious challenges to urban sustainability. To quantitatively assess the future trends of flood risks and to carry out effective adaptation measures are among the hot topics for flood risk management. A sound answer needs fine-scale data to support an integrative analysis of hydrology-hydrodynamic processes, socio-economic impacts, and adaptation measures. In this regard, this paper puts forward a set of multidisciplinary and comprehensive methods to address the frontier scientific issues. First, internet big data and machine learning methods were adopted to map the building footprint, height, and its economic values, providing a fine-scale spatial and economic information of elements at risk. The residential building footprint was mapped with an accuracy of 92.8%, and the housing price was derived via web crawler from different online real estate websites. Second, the hydrology-hydrodynamic models of TOMAWAC, TELEMAC and MIKE 1D/2D were integrated to simulate four storm-surge flooding scenarios. The scenarios are based on the real Typhoon event TC9711 on August 18, 1997, whereby the wind, wave, tide, 1D flood, and 2D flood processes are simulated and flood scenarios of four different return periods are extrapolated. Especially, for future scenarios in 2050, sea level rise and land subsidence are also considered. Third, the expected annual damage (EAD) is estimated via risk analysis technique with combination of flood maps in the four return periods and the fine-scale exposure data. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two flood adaptation measures, i.e., dry flood-proofing and wet flood-proofing measures, for residential buildings. Taking Shanghai as an example, the above methods were applied to comprehensively assess the storm-caused flood risk of residential buildings, its future trends to 2050, and the costs and benefits of two adaptation measures. The results show that: (1) Sea-level rise and land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in Shanghai. (2) Under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP8.5 High-end), the area of exposed residential buildings in Shanghai by 2050 may reach 31−49 km2 (4%–6% of total building area) for a 1/200-year storm flood event and 180–206 km2 (14%–16%) for a 1/5000-year event. (3) The EAD of residential buildings in 2017 is 440 million CNY (65.4 million USD), which can increase 1.6–2.0 times and reach to CNY 700 million–900 million (104.0 million–133.8 million USD) in 2050. (4) The implementation of both dry and wet flood-proofing measures could potentially reduce the EAD by 76%–79% and 88%–90%, respectively. Both measures are considerably cost-effective: the net present values of dry and wet flood-proofing measures are 2.84 billion–5.53 billion CNY (0.4 billion–0.8 billion USD) and 5.85 billion–9.94 billion CNY (0.9 billion–1.5 billion USD), and the benefit/cost ratios are 1.9–2.4 and 7.9–9.8 respectively. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness of dry flood-proofing measures is less than that of wet measure. Our findings can provide both scientific understanding and effective adaptation measures for mitigating the future flood risk in Shanghai. These multidisciplinary methods could also be applied to assess flood risk and adaptation strategies in other coastal cities.",,,Chinese Science Bulletin (Chinese Version),,,,2021-01-27,2021,2021-01-27,2021-10-01,66,28-29,3772-3784,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Shan, Xinmeng; Du, Shiqiang; Wang, Luyang; Zhang, Min; Li, Weijiang; Hu, Hengzhi; Wen, Jiahong","Shan, Xinmeng (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Du, Shiqiang (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;; Institute of Urban Studies, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Wang, Luyang (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Zhang, Min (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;; State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, China); Li, Weijiang (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Hu, Hengzhi (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Wen, Jiahong (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;)",,"Shan, Xinmeng (Shanghai Normal University); Du, Shiqiang (Shanghai Normal University; Shanghai Normal University); Wang, Luyang (Shanghai Normal University); Zhang, Min (Shanghai Normal University; East China Normal University); Li, Weijiang (Shanghai Normal University); Hu, Hengzhi (Shanghai Normal University); Wen, Jiahong (Shanghai Normal University)",10,7,,3.04,https://www.sciengine.com/doi/pdf/A4655197B688492EBE0FDA4E9E04D985,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141845976,37 Earth Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,13 Climate Action

Research methods. The study used such general scientific research methods as generalization and systematisation (to distinguish approaches to the definition of digitalisation from previous studies), observation, analysis and synthesis (to specify the benefits of digitalisation in the activities of organisations), which allowed the authors to analyse the concept of “digitalisation” in the context of its impact on the development of service sector enterprises. The scientific novelty of the study is to highlight and actualize the main advantages of the impact of digitalisation on the development of the service sector. Conclusions. The current challenges facing the development of the service sector require enterprises and organisations to act following current market conditions, such as globalization and digitalisation. That is why digital transformation or digitalisation is becoming a priority area of their development. It is found that, in general, digital transformation is understood as the process of integrating digital technologies into all areas of business, which is manifested in fundamental changes in how business operates and how it brings value to consumers. It is determined that digitalisation is inherent in virtually every sphere of human activity, especially in the service sector and the provision of various services, as the Internet plays an important role and has a significant impact on the daily activities of service users around the world. Digital transformation helps to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and innovation of service offerings by developing and delivering new types of services, engaging customers in the processes of creating and delivering services and improving their quality, etc. The article also examines such motivational factors for the transformation of various business structures as changes in consumer behaviour and expectations, digital shifts in companies, and changes in the competitive environment. It is established that the most active digitalisation is taking place in the public services sector. An example of such a transformation is the introduction of the Diia portal, which allows most of the needs of citizens and businesses to be met with electronic services. Digital transformation processes are also observed in education, healthcare, real estate, construction, finance, etc. The article highlights the main advantages of digitalisation as a factor in the development of the service sector, including improving the efficiency of communications with consumers, modernising information and communication technologies, expanding competitive advantages, improving the quality of services, optimising production costs and implementing improved business processes, developing digital literacy, developing the production of digital products and services, creating a positive image of the organisation in the market, etc. Digital transformation is one of the biggest trends of the 21st century, affecting a significant number of organisations moving forward.",,,Digital Platform Information Technologies in Sociocultural Sphere,,,,2023-11-13,2023,2023-11-13,,6,2,442-457,All OA; Gold,Article,"Опар, Наталія; Нішко, Богдана","Опар, Наталія (Івано-Франківський національний технічний університет нафти і газу); Нішко, Богдана (Івано-Франківський національний технічний університет нафти і газу)",,"Опар, Наталія (Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas); Нішко, Богдана (Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas)",1,1,,0.87,http://infotech-soccult.knukim.edu.ua/article/download/293619/286997,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167293879,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context",

We propose the utilization of existing organic “sensor” technology that nature has provided and discuss a future adapting these to an existing inorganic internet to truly open up a global IoT. The use of organisms, in the first instance plants, bring an additional physical and psychological factor, connecting up living in things in a way that is consistent with natural symbiosis but extended over a global and potentially galactic scale. These plants not only monitor the environment, they interact to enable it to thrive, producing an ecosystem that consumes CO2, generates oxygen, recycling land and providing an environment for other organic species to develop. In contemporary real estate development, the need for a more whole ecosystem approach is recognized and that technology plays a vital role towards that. Thus, we identify wellness and wellbeing as an integral part of all future technology development. A fundamental challenge is connecting such sensors to the IoT. We briefly review technologies of relevance in the context of material, health and environmental considerations, and discuss novel transducer mechanisms. To assess sensor capability, we review our recent work on measuring leaf material properties using contact angle mapping, demonstrating a diversity of potential for environmental monitoring from this method alone. We also review some examples of common botanical properties that already exist which can in principle be readily coupled to existing transducers to create the hybrid b-IoT. We briefly speculate into the future of materials at the sensor end and into reaching space that can meet low cost and provide advanced functionality to help connectivity and integrate fibre and fibreless technologies.","Y.

A successful business portfolio management strategy requires the integration of financial, organizational, and technological aspects to ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of the business. In modern conditions, real estate development is one of the key factors that determines the dynamics of enterprise development, as it includes a comprehensive approach to asset management, from planning and financing to the construction and operation of objects. The theoretical and methodological foundations of the genesis of development at the current stage of the construction market's evolution have been analyzed.The methodological platform for forming a business portfolio should be based on the principles of rational resource management, risk analysis, and technological optimization. Changes in development activities require the active use of digital tools and a comprehensive approach to managing residential, commercial, and industrial properties, which allows for the maximization of profitability and minimization of risks.The article discusses the main stages of portfolio formation, such as strategic planning, selection of investment objects, and their integration into the overall structure of the enterprise. An economic and mathematical formalization of the process is also provided. For the successful operation of a development company, it is crucial to ensure coordinated work at all stages of the project — from planning and financing to construction and commissioning of the facilities.Particular attention is paid to the methods of economic and mathematical modelling (EMM) and quantitative risk analysis, which have become the basis for the development of the latest asset management strategies. The study analyses 35 different techniques. Each methodology offers unique tools for the effective management of development projects that allow forecasting financial flows, determining optimal investment strategies, and building the best plans for the development of a real estate portfolio. The specific methods used to value residential, commercial and industrial real estate are also discussed, taking into account their different levels of risk and return.It is important to note that the updated methodological platform is suitable for adaptation to the latest technologies and digital tools. This includes the introduction of a project management system, the use of artificial intelligence technologies to analyse large amounts of data, and the use of analytical tools to predict market trends. This approach helps to optimise asset management in a changing market environment. The analysis of the main components of the business portfolio formation platform also showed that important factors for the successful implementation of development projects are the speed of response to market changes, flexibility of management decisions, and the ability to minimise risks at all stages of the project.",,,Building production,,,,2024-09-18,2024,2024-09-18,,,76,85,Closed,Article,"Зайчук, С.

880,pub.1109972839,10.4324/9781351139328-13,,,Data and politics of information,"In the neoliberal model of urban development, policy makers have displaced architects and urbanists in planning and designing cities, or at least, one could argue, architects and urbanists have been removed from key decisions. In many cases, the implicit claim is that the market decides the form of the city. Architects have been criticised for designing cities from top-down structuring visions, apparently proposing autonomous, unrealistic ideas. But the result of this process perhaps escapes the personal agendas of policy makers, who often end up following autonomous managerial real-estate parameters, which by default arrive at defining land ownership rights, zoning regulations, parks, infrastructure, transportation, the city fabric, the city block, and predominant building typologies. Moreover, financial parameters ended up defining urban uses without addressing architecture and urbanism as a field of study and disregarding previous revolutions in urbanism such as health, public space, and the integral relationship of cities with the environment. While this neoliberal ideology pressures public space, parks, and the environment, turning them into commodities, it seems that a clear, politically urban position today would be to activate and expand urban voids and promote latent ecologies. These issues are discussed through an academic-studio research that aims to understand the contemporary city as a topologically continuous space-environment, proposing transformations of the overall structure of New York City by specific accumulative interventions, gathering, processing, and transforming Big Data including fluid-dynamic information. Architects have been criticised for designing cities from top-down structuring visions, apparently proposing autonomous, unrealistic ideas. Standardized predetermination can be an advantage, but also quite problematic. The neoliberal model of private development, for instance “the corporate skyline,” replaced the policies based on the interests of the commons of public state development for the motto that urban growth follows finance, informing the overall structure of cities, including their infrastructure. Clusters of detached buildings developed by large, concentrated capital went against the balance of cities at multiple levels, all the way from the social to the environmental, affecting even their own interests, such as sustainable long term economic models. New technological models seem to start to address the necessary distribution demanded by democracy for transparency by empowering populations through bottom-up participatory processes.",,,,"Data, Architecture and the Experience of Place",Anastasia Karandinou,,2018-11-12,2018,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,,,210-231,Closed,Chapter,"Lorenzo-Eiroa, Pablo","Lorenzo-Eiroa, Pablo ()",,"Lorenzo-Eiroa, Pablo ()",1,0,,0.31,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1109972839,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 4407 Policy and Administration,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

With the multidisciplinary nature of science and business, an increasing number of different fields recognize the significance and utilize various types of data. A cadastral parcel, as a key component of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure, can contain diverse types of information relevant to its identification, management, and utilization. By combining well-structured and geospatially oriented data, such as geographic, ownership, historical, legal, topographic, infrastructural, tax-related, and planning data, information retrieval at the parcel level is facilitated. Considering a parcel as an ""information bearer,"" it underscores the interconnectedness between physical space and the associated data. The goal is for modern cadastral systems to integrate the National Spatial Data Infrastructure along with their subsystems, including geographic information systems, to efficiently manage and analyze parcel data, thus facilitating decision-making processes related to land administration, urban planning, real estate development, and resource management. The importance of data standardization becomes crucial for quality information management concerning parcels. Through the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the future lies in creating smart cities that utilize parcel data for optimizing land use, planning infrastructure development, fostering sustainable communities and enhancing the quality of life for citizens. These are just some of the possibilities for parcels to become a rich source of information useful for various purposes, including urban planning, land management, sustainabile development, implementation and planning of fiscal policy, and transparent inclusion of population. The integration of technologies such as GIS, data analytics, and open data promises to enhance the ability to use parcel information for timely and informed decision-making.",,,,Urbanism and sustainable development,,,2024,2024,2024,2024,,,255-260,Closed,Proceeding,"Matić Varenica, Jelena; Rikanović, Saša; Šimunić, Vanja; Šimunović, Željko","Matić Varenica, Jelena (); Rikanović, Saša (); Šimunić, Vanja (); Šimunović, Željko ()",,"Matić Varenica, Jelena (); Rikanović, Saša (); Šimunić, Vanja (); Šimunović, Željko ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171628829,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 40 Engineering; 4013 Geomatic Engineering,15 Life on Land

Extreme events, whether environmental, social, health and economic, trigger off shocks to which it is necessary to promptly react. Starting from these premises, many institutional investors are directing their capitals towards environmental interventions. In the real estate field this translates into promoting initiatives to improve the efficiency of the existing building heritage, in line with the concept of Circular Economy, and avoiding soil sealing. In the present research a composite indicator that allows to analyze the performance of different real estate investments (e.g. new construction, demolition and reconstruction, renovation, etc.) has been proposed. The performance is assessed with respect to the expected profitability, the specific characteristics of the market in which the initiatives are located and the different risk-return profiles that characterize the investors. The case study, relating to two different investments located in Rome (Italy), has allowed to test the effectiveness and the limits of the proposed indicator and the possible application fields. La crisi economica innescata dalla pandemia da Covid-19 ha determinato un diffuso clima di incertezza, evidenziando la fragilità del sistema economico e la necessità di una gestione maggiormente efficiente degli investimenti sul territorio. Eventi estremi (ambientali, sociali, sanitari, economici) generano shock ai quali è necessario reagire prontamente, e per tale ragione molti investitori istituzionali stanno indirizzando i loro capitali verso interventi sostenibili. Nel settore immobiliare questo trend si traduce nella promozione di iniziative finalizzate a migliorare l’efficienza del patrimonio edilizio esistente, coerentemente con i principi dell’economia circolare, e con il contrasto del consumo di suolo. Nella presente ricerca è stato proposto un indicatore composito, che consente di analizzare la performance di diversi investimenti immobiliari (nuove costruzioni, demolizioni e ricostruzioni, ristrutturazioni, ecc.), valutati rispetto alla redditività attesa, alle caratteristiche specifiche del mercato immobiliare di riferimento delle iniziative considerate ed ai diversi profili di rischio-rendimento degli investitori.

Using provincial panel data from China spanning from 2009 to 2021, we conducted spatial data exploratory analysis and used the dynamic spatial panel model to investigate the spatial–temporal development trends and influencing factors of GEID. The results show that (1) GEID in China exhibits significant spatial agglomeration characteristics, with an “H-H” (High-High aggregation type) agglomeration characteristic observed in three national strategic development regions: Yangtze River Delta, southeast coastal areas, and Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. (2) The spillover effect from the southeast coastal provinces gradually radiates to the northwest, resulting in an overall westward movement of GEID. (3) GEID exhibits a significant path-dependency feature in the temporal dimension and a “peer effect” in the spatial dimension. (4) Population size has the greatest impact on GEID. Population size, public participation, and the industrial and transportation sectors positively influence GEID improvement at the local level. However, they generate negative spillover effects to neighbouring provinces. Environmental status and the size of the Real Estate sector have no significant effect. Therefore, China should strengthen regional cooperation, narrow regional disparities, cultivate new quality productive forces, establish a government-led proactive disclosure mechanism under public supervision, and improve the level of GEID at the national level.",,This research was funded by Basic Scientific Research Funds in National Nonprofit Institutes (No. 2019YSKY001).,Sustainability,,,,2024-09-24,2024,2024-09-24,,16,19,8312,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xin, Boda; Lv, Lianhong; Dong, Jingjing","Xin, Boda (Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China); Lv, Lianhong (Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China); Dong, Jingjing (Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012, China)","Lv, Lianhong (Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences)","Xin, Boda (Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences); Lv, Lianhong (Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences); Dong, Jingjing (Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/su16198312,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175977871,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 44 Human Society,

The Digital Building Logbook (DBL) was introduced in 2021 as a repository of relevant building data to facilitate informed decision-making and information sharing among stakeholders. In Spain, both tools (DBL + SRR) have been studied separately in an incipient way. However, the interconnection of data in the tools come from the same document base. Evidence suggests that when building information is used in isolation, its value is diluted without stakeholder awareness. In this paper, we move towards unifying both tools (DBL+SRR) in a single comprehensive tool called the Libro del Edificio Electrónico (LdE-e), with the aim of producing a single building database to drive multi-building renovations. For this purpose, the data fields of existing building information, assessment and management tools in Spain were studied in detail and reinterpreted in a new interconnected data structure. To evaluate the formulation of the LdE-e proposal, 11 semi-structured interviews were held with a panel of 13 experts specialized in real estate, building and energy efficiency. After these sessions, the LdE-e was reformulated, and the model was strengthened by analyzing vectors such as governance, management, usability, data flows, stakeholders and the impact of including new technologies such as BIM and blockchain. The results suggest that the LdE-e would improve control of the operation and maintenance of (new or existing) buildings, the programming of renovation actions based on deficits identified in technical inspections, and other aspects.","The authors greatly appreciate the detailed contributions and criticism of reviewers.

795,pub.1183734440,10.54264/m038,,,EDUCATION AND ECONOMY IN THE DIGITAL AGE,"In the contemporary world, the rapid advancement of technology has significantly influenced various sectors, including education, society, and the economy. The growing integration of digital tools and innovative approaches has redefined the way we approach learning, entrepreneurship, and financial systems. As a result, a new paradigm is emerging – one that emphasizes the use of cuttingedge technologies to enhance productivity, streamline processes, and create more dynamic, adaptable environments. This monograph seeks to explore these dynamic changes across multiple disciplines, with a particular focus on education, global entrepreneurship, and finance. The goal is to understand how digital innovations are shaping the future and what strategies are being developed to meet the challenges of this new digital era. Chapter 1, titled ""Innovative Approaches and Digital Integration in Modern Education: Tools, Technologies, and Pedagogical Strategies,"" addresses the profound impact of digitalization on the educational landscape. Education, as one of the most critical drivers of societal progress, has undergone significant transformations due to the adoption of digital platforms and technologies. Traditional learning environments are giving way to more flexible and interactive models that blend in-person and virtual elements, enabling learners to access educational resources from anywhere, at any time. The implementation of educational platforms in foreign language learning, particularly in blended learning formats, demonstrates how technology is reshaping the instructional process to cater to diverse learning needs and preferences. Additionally, the use of mobile applications has transformed universities into customeroriented digital ecosystems. These applications enhance communication between students and faculty, streamline administrative processes, and offer a personalized approach to education. As the digital information environment becomes more integrated into the daily operations of educational institutions, it fosters a more efficient and responsive system that meets the needs of a diverse student population. The chapter also examines the role of personnel policies in managing the motivational component of medical personnel, a crucial aspect in the context of education and training in medical fields. The culture of innovative communication among modern teachers is equally critical. This section explores how professional communication strategies and innovative cultural practices among educators influence the quality of education and the effectiveness of learning environments. A particularly intriguing topic in this chapter is the role of podcasts and artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education. These tools are becoming increasingly important in enhancing the educational experience by providing new avenues for information dissemination, personalized learning, and student engagement. The use of AI in educational settings is not just a futuristic concept but a reality that is shaping the way students interact with educational content and how institutions tailor learning experiences to individual needs. Moreover, the chapter discusses the use of the case study method in teaching geography in Ukrainian schools. This method promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, and the application of theoretical knowledge in practical situations, aligning with the goals of the new Ukrainian school reforms. The integration of smart learning environments, particularly in countries like Malaysia, is also explored, highlighting how real estate development and infrastructure changes influence secondary education structures. These smart environments offer a glimpse into the future of education, where technology and physical space are seamlessly integrated to create optimal learning conditions. The psychological and pedagogical aspects of organizing educational interactions in vocational training systems are another critical focus of this chapter. These aspects are essential for ensuring that vocational training remains relevant and effective in a rapidly changing job market. Additionally, the challenges and prospects of organizing inclusive physical education are examined, highlighting the importance of developing adaptable educational practices that cater to students with diverse physical abilities. 6 As the chapter progresses, it delves into the increasing informatization and digitalization of educational processes in higher education institutions. These trends are not merely about adopting new technologies but also about fundamentally transforming the way educational content is delivered, assessed, and managed. The technological support for distance education, particularly during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has shown the importance of having robust digital infrastructures that can support continuous learning. The design and modeling of systems for developing professional competencies in future specialists are also explored, emphasizing the need for education to evolve in tandem with the demands of the modern workforce. Chapter 2, ""Innovations and Emerging Technologies in Global Entrepreneurship, Tourism, and Finance,"" takes the discussion beyond education and into the realms of global business and economic management. The role of innovative entrepreneurship as a driving force for economic development is examined, highlighting how new business models, digital tools, and creative thinking are fostering economic growth in various sectors. This chapter provides an in-depth look at the challenges and opportunities that arise in international tourism, particularly in tourist macroregions around the world. The tourism industry, which is deeply interconnected with global economic trends, has been significantly impacted by digital innovations, from marketing strategies to customer service enhancements. The chapter also explores the health information focus of student youth, addressing how access to digital health information and services is shaping the health behaviors and outcomes of younger generations.

710,pub.1164658395,10.2139/ssrn.4584643,,,The Evolving Landscape of Organizational Structures: A Contemporary Analysis,"Organizational structures form the backbone of modern businesses, defining how tasks are allocated, roles are defined, and communication flows within an organization. In today's dynamic and rapidly evolving business landscape, organizations are embracing a variety of structural models to adapt to changing market demands, technological advancements, and workforce dynamics. This article offers insights into the current landscape of organizational structures employed by businesses across industries. It explores traditional structures such as functional, divisional, and matrix models and examines how they have evolved to meet the challenges of the digital age. Additionally, it highlights emerging structures and innovative approaches that reflect the need for flexibility, collaboration, and agility in modern organizations. Functional structures, characterized by departmentalization based on specialized functions like marketing, finance, and operations, continue to provide clarity in role definitions and efficient resource allocation. However, they are increasingly complemented by cross-functional teams and agile frameworks to foster innovation and responsiveness. Divisional structures, organized around products, geographic regions, or customer segments, enable organizations to tailor their strategies to specific markets. In response to globalization and market diversification, organizations are adopting hybrid structures that blend functional and divisional elements to strike a balance between specialization and integration. Matrix structures, combining both functional and divisional lines of authority, facilitate collaboration across various dimensions. They are particularly valuable for project-based work and are being enhanced with digital tools to streamline communication and decision-making. Innovation in organizational structures is evident through network structures, team-based approaches, and holacracy-inspired models. Network structures leverage partnerships, alliances, and outsourcing to maximize efficiency and leverage external expertise. Team-based structures empower employees by organizing work around cross-functional, self-managed teams, promoting creativity and employee engagement. Technological advancements, including digital platforms, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, have reshaped how organizations operate and communicate. Remote work and virtual teams are now commonplace, prompting organizations to rethink their structures and real estate strategies. Environmental and social considerations are driving organizations to incorporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) into their structures. Ethical business practices and a commitment to environmental stewardship are increasingly integral to the fabric of modern organizations.

Real estate market and energy performance of homes,"The energy transition and decarbonisation require a major transformation of the housing stock. Responsible for around 40% of fossil fuel consumption and 30% of CO2 emissions, the built heritage must be upgraded in terms of energy performance. The issue is particularly sensitive for Italy, where seven out of ten homes are in the worst energy classes according to the classification introduced by the EU. The research aimed at investigating whether, and to what extent, energy-efficient homes command a premium price on the market compared to less efficient homes. The study focused on three medium-sized cities in northern Italy and developed three hedonic models based on more than 900 ask prices. The results confirm the stratification of the market in terms of energy efficiency levels. Estimates converge in absolute and relative terms between different cities. Particularly significant is the average gap found between properties in the highest efficiency class (Class A) and those in the lowest efficiency class (Class G), with values of around thirty percentage points, while the gap is around fourteen percentage points if we consider properties in Class D compared to Class G. The conclusions are in line with European studies on the subject, but show a trend towards an increasing gap between the market values of properties with different energy performance classes. La transizione energetica e la decarbonizzazione impongono un’importante trasformazione del patrimonio abitativo. Responsabile di circa il 40% dei consumi di combustibili fossili e del 30% delle emissioni di CO2, il patrimonio costruito deve essere riqualificato sotto il profilo delle performance energetiche. Il tema è particolarmente delicato per l’Italia, dove sette abitazioni su dieci appartengono alle classi energetiche meno performanti secondo la classificazione introdotta dall’UE. La ricerca si è proposta di indagare se, e in quale misura, le abitazioni energeticamente performanti riscontrino sul mercato un premium price rispetto alle abitazioni meno efficienti. L’indagine si concentra su tre città medie del Nord Italia e ha sviluppato tre modelli edonici sulla base di oltre 900 prezzi d’offerta. I risultati confermano la stratificazione del mercato rispetto ai livelli di efficienza energetica. Le stime risultano convergenti in termini assoluti e relativi tra le diverse città. Particolarmente significativo è lo scarto medio rilevato tra immobili appartenenti alla classe di massima efficienza (classe A) rispetto a quelli di minima efficienza (classe G) con valori che si attestano a circa trenta punti percentuali, mentre lo scarto si attesta in- torno a quattordici punti percentuali se consideriamo immobili della classe D rispetto alla classe G. Le conclusioni si allineano agli studi europei sull’argomento ed evidenziano tuttavia una tendenza alla crescente divaricazione tra i valori di mercato degli immobili caratterizzati da diverse prestazioni energetiche.",,,Valori e Valutazioni,,,,2023-11,2023,,,34,,3-16,All OA; Gold,Article,"Micelli, Ezio; Gilberto, Giulia; Righetto, Eleonora; Tafuri, Greta","Micelli, Ezio (Department of Architecture and Arts, Università Iuav di Venezia); Gilberto, Giulia (Department of Architecture and Arts, Università Iuav di Venezia); Righetto, Eleonora (Department of Industrial Systems Technology and Management, Università di Padova); Tafuri, Greta (Department of Architecture and Arts, Università Iuav di Venezia)",,"Micelli, Ezio (Università Iuav di Venezia); Gilberto, Giulia (Università Iuav di Venezia); Righetto, Eleonora (University of Padua); Tafuri, Greta (Università Iuav di Venezia)",3,3,,,https://siev.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/02_MICELLI-ET-AL-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168300380,,

It was found that the organization of effective and durable land management systems requires long-term investments and constant state support. Thus, a protected legal status and an efficient land market result in more credit and investment, which leads to higher productivity and economic growth and, accordingly, to higher incomes and higher living standards. It is emphasized that the basis of the management organization of the use of land resources is the state land cadastre. The use of the state land cadastre as the main tool for the management of the use of land resources has the following meaning: guarantee of ownership and its protection; support for land and real estate taxation; provision of loan guarantees; development of land markets and their monitoring; protection of land resources and support for environmental monitoring; assistance in land management of state lands; reducing the number of land disputes; promotion of land reform and development of rural areas; improvement of urban planning and infrastructure development; obtaining statistical data on land plots. It is proposed that when organizing the management of the use of land resources, we suggest taking into account such characteristics as systems formed according to the principle of contradictions, in particular: first, ensuring the sustainability of the land resources management system, which is dynamic in itself; secondly, the credibility and transparency of the land management system, as well as the confidentiality and protection of personal data; thirdly, taking into account the ""human factor"" in the automation of the land resources management system; fourth, the universality of land resource management systems with the uniqueness of each of them. The specified characteristics were formed using one of the methods of scientific thinking and the principles of the laws of logic - the principle of contradictions. Contradiction as such does not ensure development. However, philosophical dialectic consists precisely in the ability to feel, reveal, realize the depth of the contradiction and find the possibility of a complex solution.",,,Economic scope,,,,2022,2022,2022,2022,,180,71-75,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Полтавець, А.М.","Полтавець, А.М.

Modernity is increasingly in need of energy-efficient construction. Exhaustion of resources and their travel is a problem, the solution of which is adopted by many innovative branches and links of construction. In the 21st century, solving the issue of energy efficiency has many creative and effective variations. Focusing on clean and renewable energy from the sun is one of the ways to overcome the energy crisis. This is an active solar architecture. Active solar architecture incorporates the idea of harnessing the sun's renewable energy, turning it into clean electricity that covers the user's problems. The article provides several examples of the practice of construction of active solar buildings in different countries. Undoubtedly, active solar architecture attracts more and more users to purchase this type of real estate. In this regard, more and more offices and construction companies are focusing on this type of architecture. A list of benefits of active solar architecture meets environmental and energy-efficient needs. The modern design of such buildings corresponds to today's stylistic and aesthetic trends. The shape and silhouette of these buildings varies from traditional to postmodern trends. The concept of solar architecture represents the idea of renewable energy and the autonomy of the architectural unit. Self-sufficiency in electricity and automation of the organization of the internal climate, creating comfortable conditions for a person to stay – the key purpose of active solar architecture. Its purpose is not only to organize maximum autonomous comfort, but also to reduce the negative impact on the environment as much as possible. This sets another goal for the energy-efficient design of solar architecture – directly to be comfortable and least harmful. The main requirements for the quality and aesthetics of solar design depend on current requirements and global trends. Saving electricity is one of them. The opportunity not only to save money, but also to obtain a material monetary interest from energy production. Such implementation exists in Denmark, where a state program was organized to encourage energy-efficient autonomy of buildings and structures. First of all, most European countries are developing or already follow state programs of this kind.",,,Regional problems of architecture and urban planning,,,,2022-12-23,2022,2022-12-23,2022-12-23,,16,99-105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Malashenkova, V.

These changes are caused by the constant need to maintain stability, competitiveness and sustainable economic growth of banks. Today, the digital economy occupies a special place in all spheres of public life, and also undoubtedly affects the financial sector. Thanks to modern digital technologies, we can see not only the emergence of new electronic financial services and products, but also the modernization of the forms in which they are provided. At the same time, the most significant transformations are taking place in the field of consumer banking and payments. In the article the authors analyzed the key stages of the development of banking products, in particular the search for new technological solutions and market segments such as insurance business, financial leasing, asset management and real estate investment. The authors described the key development trends such as customer focus, controlling and innovation management. It has also been proved that all the latest trends that have emerged in the banking sector over the last period of time are determined by a common prerequisite – the development of information technology. In particular, the impact of information technologies on individual banking institutions with the aim of introducing innovative banking products and services, such as mobile and online payments, deposit and trading account management programs, is investigated. Attention is focused on such modern technologies as blockchain and cryptocurrency, as well as the impact of remote services. It is proved that the remote mode of operation has become a corporate standard for many Ukrainian banks, because today with the help of a phone or tablet it is possible to control the financial results of banking operations, analyze financial indicators and receive automatic notifications about events that require special attention. The authors also gave the most striking examples of innovations in the banking sector – such companies were «Capgemini» and Ukrainian Monobank. The authors conclude that the prospects for further research lie in an in-depth consideration of the process of diffusion of banking innovations depending on various macroeconomic and microeconomic factors, as well as the nature and key properties of innovations in the banking industry according to their classification.",,,Herald UNU International Economic Relations And World Economy,,,,2022,2022,2022,2022,,43,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Vincenti, Emilia; University, Uzhhorod National; Kushnir, Natalia","Vincenti, Emilia (); University, Uzhhorod National (); Kushnir, Natalia ()",,"Vincenti, Emilia (); University, Uzhhorod National (); Kushnir, Natalia ()",2,2,,0.98,https://doi.org/10.32782/2413-9971/2022-43-5,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155698189,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context",

                  Mending Termini Station és el títol d'una experimentació acadèmica que ha estat tractada i aprofundida entre 2017 i 2018 en el context d'un Màster en finances immobiliàries (a la LUISS Business School a Roma), un Taller internacional de planificació urbana i arquitectura (amb la participació de les universitats de Roma Tre i Sapienza, de Roma, ETSAB / UPC, de Barcelona, UFRGS, de Porto Alegre - Brasil, i UNR, de Rosario - Argentina) i diversos cursos d'Urbanisme al Departament d'Arquitectura de la Universitat Roma Tre.L'experimentació es funda sobre l'anomalia genètica de les ciutats italianes, lligades al transport per carretera (acte particulars, busos i camions), que mostra progressivament i dramàticament les seves conseqüències, especialment a la ciutat de Roma - que té el territori municipal més ampli de Europa. El ""cura del ferro,"" promès pel Pla Regulador municipal de 2008, que contemplava noves línies de metro, tramvies, ferroviàries, corredors preferencials de transport públic i el tancament del cinturó ferroviari a la part nord de Roma, lamentablement segueix apareixent en les cròniques causa de fallides i interrupcions.La congestió del trànsit vehicular, a causa de l'estructura radial de la xarxa viària romana (que segueix l'estructura de les antigues carreteres consulars), la ineficiència del transport públic i el flux mono direccional de viatgers diaris ai del centre de la ciutat, involucra tota l'àrea metropolitana i paralitza tots els dies als ciutadans.En particular, l'estructura dels ferrocarrils sembla penalitzada pel cinturó que encara no s'ha completat, per una nova estació per als trens d'Alta Velocitat, l'Estació Tiburtina, subutilizada causa de la presència dominant de l'Estació Termini, l'estació principal de Roma, on arriben la majoria dels trens regionals i Alta Velocitat.Per la seva ubicació, a cavall entre les Muralles Antiga de l'Emperador Aureliano, que envolten el centre històric de Roma, l'Estació Termini es caracteritza com un tall al mig del cor de la ciutat, un fragment urbà que separa els barris Esquilino, Castro Pretorio , Sant Llorenç, i que atreu fenòmens al mateix temps de degradació i turistificació massiva.El projecte Mending Termini Station està inspirat en una hipòtesi del Pla Regulador de 1931 (per l'arquitecte Marcello Piacentini). Aquest Pla, al final d'un llarg debat que va durar més de cinquanta anys, va proposar l'eliminació de l'estació de Termini, construïda al quadrant oriental del centre històric de Roma, reemplaçant-amb un ferrocarril subterrani i una nova estació ferroviària, també aquesta subterrània , i el tancament simultani de l'anell ferroviari cap al nord. La zona de Termini, un cop alliberada de la infraestructura ferroviària, estava destinada a convertir-se en un nou centre direccional amb característiques monumentals, en línia amb el que es va aconseguir en altres capitals europees.Mending Termini Station actualitza les idees de planificació de 1931: l'eliminació de l'actual estació de Termini, reemplaçada per un nou traçat ferroviari subterrani i una nova estació, també subterrània, únicament per al Alta Velocitat; la reutilització i valorització de l'Estació del 1949 i de la seva gran àrea central, alliberada dels rails; el tancament del cinturó ferroviari amb la reorganització de la mobilitat i del transport públic de tota l'àrea metropolitana de Roma. Tot això, en total conformitat amb les regulacions europees sobre la liberalització del mercat ferroviari.L'assaig il·lustrarà els estudis preparatoris, les anàlisis històrics, el model actual, les avaluacions crítiques i els mètodes de construcció de les propostes. La metodologia d'implementació ha previst un joc de rol, on van estar representats els tres actors principals de la transformació urbana: el Municipi, l'empresa que gestiona la xarxa ferroviària i els edificis ferroviaris, RFI Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (Grup Ferrovie dello Stato) i finalment els ciutadans mateixos.Les solucions proposades es caracteritzen per la seva factibilitat urbana, de transport i mobilitat i també socioeconòmica. Per tant, constitueixen una proposta sostenible per a la ciutat de Roma i el seu sistema de transport públic.
                  Mending Termini Station is the title of an academic experimentation that has been treated and deepened between 2017 and 2018 in the context of a Master in Real Estate Finance (at the LUISS Business School in Rome), an international workshop on urban planning and architecture (with the participation of the universities Roma Tre and Sapienza, of Rome, ETSAB / UPC, of Barcelona, UFRGS, of Porto Alegre - Brazil, and UNR, of Rosario - Argentina) and Urban Planning Laboratories at the Department of Architecture of the University “Rome Tre”.The experimentation is based on the genetic anomaly of the Italian cities, linked to road transport (private cars, buses and trucks), that progressively and dramatically shows its consequences, especially in the city of Rome - which has the broadest municipal territory of Europe. The ""care of iron"", promised by the Municipal Regulatory Plan of 2008, which contemplated new subway lines, trams, railways, preferential corridors of public transport and the closure of the railway belt in the northern part of Rome, unfortunately continues to appear in the chronicles due to bankruptcies and interruptions.The congestion of vehicular traffic, due to the radial structure of the Roman road network (which follows the structure of the ancient consular roads), the inefficiency of public transport and the monodirectional flow of commuters to and from the center of the city, involves the entire area metropolitan and paralyzes citizens every day.In particular, the structure of the railways seems to be penalized by the belt that has not yet been completed, by a new station for high-speed trains, the Tiburtina station, underutilized due to the dominant presence of the Termini station, the main station of Rome, where most of the regional and high-speed trains arrive.Because of its location, halfway between the Ancient Walls of Emperor Aureliano, which surround the historical centre of Rome, Termini Station is characterized as a cut in the middle of the heart of the city, an urban fragment that separates the Esquilino, Castro Pretorio and San Lorenzo neighborhoods, and that attracts phenomena at the same time of degradation and massive touristification.The Mending Termini Station project is inspired by a hypothesis of the 1931 Regulatory Plan (by architect Marcello Piacentini). The Plan, at the end of a long debate that lasted more than fifty years, proposed the elimination of the Termini station, built in the eastern quadrant of the historic center of Rome, replacing it with an underground railway and a new railway station, also underground, and the simultaneous closure of the railway ring to the north. The area of Termini, once freed from the railway infrastructure, was destined to become a new directional center with monumental characteristics, in line with what was achieved in other European capitals.Mending Termini Station updates the planning ideas of 1931: the elimination of the current Termini Station, replaced by a new underground railway line and a new station, also underground, only for High Speed Trains; the reuse and recovery of the 1949 Station and its large central area, freed from the rails; the closure of the railway belt, with the reorganization of mobility and public transport throughout the metropolitan area of Rome. All this, in full compliance with European regulations on the liberalization of the rail market.This essay will illustrate the preparatory studies, the historical studies, the current model, the critical evaluations and the methods of construction of the proposals. The implementation methodology has planned a role-play, where the three main actors of the urban transformation were represented: The Municipality, the company that manages the railway network and the railway buildings, RFI Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (Gruppo Ferrovie dello Stato) and finally the citizens themselves.The proposed solutions are characterized by their urban, transport and mobility and also socioeconomic feasibility. Therefore, they constitute a sustainable proposal for the city of Rome and its public transport system.",,,,"Libro de proceedings, CTV 2018: XII Congreso Internacional Ciudad y Territorio Virtual: “Ciudades y Territorios Inteligentes”: UNCuyo, Mendoza, 5-7 septiembre 2018",,,2018-12,2018,2018-12,,,,227-246,All OA; Hybrid,Proceeding,"Cerasoli, Mario; Amato, Chiara","Cerasoli, Mario (); Amato, Chiara ()",,"Cerasoli, Mario (); Amato, Chiara ()",0,0,,,https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/2117/132262/1/8243-5953-1-SM.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117339991,,
