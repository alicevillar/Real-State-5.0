However, this study raises the question of what attributes of an apartment are most likely to influence a price revision during the pandemic. The findings in prior studies have lacked consensus, especially regarding the time-on-the-market variable, which exhibits an omnidirectional effect. However, with the rise of Big Data, this study used a web-scraping algorithm and collected a total of 18,992 property listings in the city of Vilnius during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Afterwards, 15 different machine learning models were applied to forecast apartment revisions, and the SHAP values for interpretability were used. The findings in this study coincide with the previous literature results, affirming that real estate is quite resilient to pandemics, as the price drops were not as dramatic as first believed. Out of the 15 different models tested, extreme gradient boosting was the most accurate, although the difference was negligible. The retrieved SHAP values conclude that the time-on-the-market variable was by far the most dominant and consistent variable for price revision forecasting. Additionally, the time-on-the-market variable exhibited an inverse U-shaped behaviour.",Not applicable.,Funding is provided by the Kaunas University of Technology.,Journal of Big Data,,,,2021-08-03,2021,2021-08-03,2021-12,8,1,105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Grybauskas, Andrius; Pilinkienė, Vaida; Stundžienė, Alina","Grybauskas, Andrius (School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, K.

Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors’ names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.",,This research received no external funding.,Big Data and Cognitive Computing,,,,2020-03-26,2020,2020-03-26,,4,2,4,All OA; Gold,Article,"Munawar, Hafiz Suliman; Qayyum, Siddra; Ullah, Fahim; Sepasgozar, Samad","Munawar, Hafiz Suliman (Faculty of Built Environment, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;, f.ullah@unsw.edu.au, (F.U.);, sepas@unsw.edu.au, (S.S.)); Qayyum, Siddra (School of Project Management, University of Sydney, Camperdown, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia;, siddra.qayyum@sydney.edu.au); Ullah, Fahim (Faculty of Built Environment, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;, f.ullah@unsw.edu.au, (F.U.);, sepas@unsw.edu.au, (S.S.)); Sepasgozar, Samad (Faculty of Built Environment, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;, f.ullah@unsw.edu.au, (F.U.);, sepas@unsw.edu.au, (S.S.))","Munawar, Hafiz Suliman (UNSW Sydney; Faculty of Built Environment, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;, f.ullah@unsw.edu.au, (F.U.);, sepas@unsw.edu.au, (S.S.))","Munawar, Hafiz Suliman (UNSW Sydney; Faculty of Built Environment, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;, f.ullah@unsw.edu.au, (F.U.);, sepas@unsw.edu.au, (S.S.)); Qayyum, Siddra (The University of Sydney); Ullah, Fahim (UNSW Sydney; Faculty of Built Environment, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;, f.ullah@unsw.edu.au, (F.U.);, sepas@unsw.edu.au, (S.S.)); Sepasgozar, Samad (UNSW Sydney; Faculty of Built Environment, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;, f.ullah@unsw.edu.au, (F.U.);, sepas@unsw.edu.au, (S.S.))",123,66,,101.49,https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/4/2/4/pdf?version=1585737740,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125965197,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

As they re-emerge from the Covid 19 pandemic and get ready to face climate change and other, potentially existential threats, they need to look for new ways to support wealth and wellbeing creation – leveraging Big Data and AI and suing them into their physical reality and to become greener, more inclusive and resilient, hence sustainable. This book describes how new digital technologies could be used to design digital and physical twins of cities that are able to feed into each other to optimize their working and ability to create new wealth and wellbeing. The book also describes how to increase cities’ social and economic resilience during crisis time and addressing their almost fatal weaknesses – as it became all too obvious during the recent COVID 19 crisis. Also, the book presents a framework for a critical discussion of the concept of “smart-city”, suggesting its development into a “cyber” and “meta” one – meaning, not only digital systems can allow physical ones (e.g. cities, citizens, households and companies) to become “smarter”, but also the vice versa is true, as off line data and real life behaviours can support the optimization and development of virtual brains as a sum of big data and artificial intelligence apps all sitting “over the cloud”. An analysis of the fundamental dynamics of this emerging “info-telligence” economy, and of the potential role of big digital players like Amazon, Google and Facebook is then paving the way to discuss a few strategic forays on how traditional sectors such as financial services, real estate, TMT or health could also evolve, leveraging Big Data and AI in a cyber-physical integrated setting. Finally, a number of thought provoking use cases that could be designed around individuals, and to improve the success and the resilience of households and companies living and working in urban areas are discussed, as an example of one of the most exciting future markets to come: the one of global, sustainable cities",,,,,,,2021,2021,,2021,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Scardovi, Claudio","Scardovi, Claudio (HOPE SpA, Milan, Italy)",,"Scardovi, Claudio (HOPE SpA, Milan, Italy)",4,2,,4.44,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136721826,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Design/methodology/approach This conceptual study follows, methodologically, the structuring inter-textual coherence process – specifically, the synthesised coherence tactical approach. It draws heavily on theoretical evidence published, mainly, in the corporate finance and the business management literature.   Findings A new conceptual framework is presented for CRE to proactively develop insights into the potential benefits of using BD as a business strategy/instrument. The approach was found to strengthen decision-making processes and encourage better RM – with significant consequences, in particular, for business process management (BPM). Specifically, by recognising the potential uses of BD, it is also possible to redefine the processes with advantages in terms of RM.   Originality/value This study contributes to the literature in the fields of real estate, RM, BPM and digital transformation. To the best knowledge of authors, although the literature has examined the concepts of BD, RM and BP, no prior studies have comprehensively examined these three elements and their conjoint contribution to CRE. In particular, the study highlights how the automation of data-intensive activities and the analysis of such data (in both structured and unstructured forms), as a means of supporting decision making, can lead to better efficiency in RM and optimisation of processes.",,,Business Process Management Journal,,,,2020-09-07,2020,,2020-09-07,26,5,1141-1155,All OA; Green,Article,"Battisti, Enrico; Shams, S.M.

AI is being used in the real estate sector to improve various aspects of the industry such as property search, pricing, marketing, and risk management. There are various techniques used for predicting house prices, including linear regression, decision tree and random forest. These algorithms can take into account factors such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant characteristics of the property. Predicting house prices with AI has many advantages over traditional methods, such as the ability a) to handle large amounts of data and b) to identify patterns and trends that might be overlooked by humans. It can also help us understand why housing prices are changing, and what factors are driving these changes. This information can be invaluable for real estate agents, investors, and homeowners who need to make informed decisions regarding the market.

Traditional Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods often fall short in capturing the dynamic nature of long-term real estate projects, particularly in adapting to market uncertainties and changes. This research addresses these limitations by employing a multi-real option model, which allows for flexibility in decision-making by evaluating various investment phases through the binomial lattice framework. The analysis demonstrates that the STO-based project financing (STO-PF) model, when applied to the Aspen Resort, provides superior financial outcomes and strategic advantages compared to conventional DCF methods. Key findings reveal that the STO-PF model enhances liquidity, democratizes investment access, and offers improved risk management through digital platforms. The results showcase how integrating STOs with real option models quantifies the project’s expanded net present value (ENPV), thereby optimizing investment decisions under volatile market conditions. This study not only contributes theoretically to the literature on STO financing but also provides practical implications for developers seeking flexible and innovative financing solutions in real estate.

This study addresses these issues by proposing a method which integrates blockchain technology with real estate joint ownership, focusing on the development and deployment of a smart matching algorithm in a blockchain-based joint ownership platform. The smart matching algorithm is crucial for efficiently pairing co-owners with aligned interests and trust levels, minimizing conflicts and ensuring cohesive group dynamics. A systematic analysis of performance metrics, such as execution times, resource usage, and security vulnerabilities, is performed. The experiment results indicate substantial improvements in operational efficiency and security: user verification is processed in approximately 0.00057 seconds per user, group creation in about 0.00017 seconds, and smart matching in 0.00013 seconds. Additionally, the platform demonstrates minimal gas consumption for key operations and low memory usage and is resilient to common attacks like Sybil and front-running with no critical vulnerabilities detected.

The existing real estate information systems require more robust and resilient cybersecurity solutions to secure hardware, software, and databases. Cybersecurity often relies on user behavior. Phishing attacks and social engineering can bypass blockchain security, highlighting the need for robust user education and awareness. Many blockchain networks face challenges in handling a high volume of transactions. Solutions that work well on a small scale may not perform efficiently as the network grows, leading to delays and increased costs. A secure system is a significant area in cybersecurity that protects digital transactions from unauthorized access. This paper proposes a new real estate transaction encryption scheme using the modified SLIM cryptography algorithm in the context of blockchain based on a 2Dimension Chialvo map with high nonlinearity generation of the substitution box (S-Box) to make it robust against many linear attacks, which is a novel approach to enhancing transaction speed and security. Modifying lightweight SLIM cryptography is highly resistant to linear and differential cryptanalysis attacks, providing adequate protection. The modified lightweight SLIM cryptography applies to wireless networks, IoT applications, and real estate systems.

1468,pub.1186630010,10.5194/egusphere-egu25-78,,,"Enhancing Community Resilience, Flood Risk Assessment, and Decision-Making in the Face of Extreme Weather Events","Recent catastrophic storms and flood events—including Hurricanes Helene and Milton (2024), Ian (2022) in the United States, and severe floods in Valencia, Spain (2024), Belgium, and Germany (2021)—highlight the critical need for comprehensive resilience planning in coastal and riverine communities. With a global rise in both the frequency and severity of weather and climate disasters, coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable, facing significant risks and economic losses. This work presents an integrated framework to support flood resilience and optimize evacuation strategies by leveraging big data, high-resolution flood and storm surge models, and advanced predictive tools. This framework combines high-resolution computational fluid dynamics and finite element models to evaluate flood damage and structural vulnerability under different hurricane intensities. By capturing both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in hazard assessment, building resilience, and community preparedness, it provides a robust basis for proactive flood risk management. The framework also includes a multidimensional flood-damage assessment model, which goes beyond traditional depth–damage relationships by incorporating building-specific factors such as height, age, configuration, and construction material. Structural resilience is calculated as a function of recovery time, community preparedness, and the severity of flood-induced damage, thus enabling a detailed, community-scale risk assessment. Validated through large-scale storm surge and 2D inundation simulations, this framework offers actionable insights for emergency managers, policymakers, and local stakeholders. By integrating hydrodynamics, structural data, and socio-economic factors, this comprehensive approach empowers communities with data-driven resources for making informed decisions to reduce risk and improve adaptive capacity. This framework is positioned to be highly impactful for diverse users—including property owners, insurance companies, real estate businesses, and regional decision-makers—as it addresses the complex challenges of flood resilience in the face of increasing extreme weather events.",,,,,,,2025-04-01,2025,2025-04-01,,,,,Closed,Article,"Nazari, Rouzbeh; Karimi, Maryam","Nazari, Rouzbeh (); Karimi, Maryam ()",,"Nazari, Rouzbeh (); Karimi, Maryam ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1186630010,37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences; 3709 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 13 Climate Action

These settlements have flourished in the city due to demand for low cost housing, private real estate greed for profits and institutional negligence of administrative authorities. Lack of affordable housing and mushrooming of unauthorized constructions combined with mixed land use has scraped the urban landscape with such dried out and wilted village areas as islands. These settlements are witness to rampant violations of safety measures such as Floor Space Index, building bye laws and regulations, social infrastructure and adequate public spaces. The exposure to hazards is further escalated due to increasing population density vis a vis the carrying capacity of the land. The demand for urban services has increased disproportionately in comparison to the capacity of the institutions responsible for providing these services. Further, the intersection of national, state and local jurisdiction in the city has resulted in several complexities and challenges in urban governance. In such a scenario of increasing vulnerabilities and inadequate institutional capacities, technology holds the promise to bridge some crucial gaps in governance. However, technology in itself is a double-edged sword and so, participation of community becomes crucial for transparency and accountability.

                    Design/methodology/approach
                    By means of an artificial neural network, market sentiment is extracted from 66,070 US real estate market news articles from the S&P Global Market Intelligence database. For training of the network, a distant supervision approach utilizing 17,822 labeled investment ideas from the crowd-sourced investment advisory platform Seeking Alpha is applied.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    According to the results of autoregressive distributed lag models including contemporary and lagged sentiment as independent variables, the derived textual sentiment indicator is not only significantly linked to the depth and resilience dimensions of market liquidity (proxied by Amihud’s (2002) price impact measure), but also to the breadth dimension (proxied by transaction volume).

1261,pub.1184409843,10.3390/buildings15020216,,,A Case Study on Multi-Real-Option-Integrated STO-PF Models for Strengthening Capital Structures in Real Estate Development,"This study examines the integration of multi-real-option valuation and security token offering (STO) as an innovative approach to real estate project financing. The case study of Aspen Resort Development serves to illustrate this methodology. The traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) method is frequently ill-suited to the dynamic and uncertain nature of long-term real estate projects, particularly in regard to the ability to adapt to market fluctuations. In order to address these limitations, this study employs a multi-real-option model with a binomial lattice framework, thereby facilitating flexible decision-making in various investment stages. The analysis demonstrates that the STO-based project financing (STO-PF) model offers enhanced financial performance and strategic advantages in comparison to the conventional DCF approach. Furthermore, the STO-PF model has the effect of increasing liquidity, expanding investment accessibility, and improving risk management through the utilization of digital platforms. By quantifying the project’s extended net present value (ENPV), the integration of STOs with real-options models can facilitate optimal investment decisions in the context of a high level of market volatility. Consequently, the STO-PF model is determined to yield a project value (E) of USD 7.34 million and a real-options value (ROV) of USD 3.69 million. This is markedly higher than the net present value (NPV) of USD 3.65 million derived from the traditional project finance (PF) model. Furthermore, the put option for the second investment stage contributes USD 16.45 million to the overall value of the project, thereby demonstrating the flexibility and strategic advantages of the STO framework in comparison to static NPV analysis. The Aspen project serves as a case study, demonstrating the financial viability of phased investments in dynamic market conditions. It contributes to the theoretical understanding of STO-based financing and provides practical insights for developers seeking flexible and innovative financing solutions in the real estate sector. Further research is required to confirm the applicability of STOs in diverse market environments and regulatory contexts. Additionally, in-depth research is necessary to integrate emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, into multi-real-option-based financial platforms. This integration aims to enhance financial modeling and decision-making processes, as well as to facilitate the integration of digital technologies in this field. Only then can the development and implementation of smart construction development advance.",,This research received no external funding.,Buildings,,,,2025-01-13,2025,2025-01-13,,15,2,216,All OA; Gold,Article,"Park, Jung Kyu; Lee, Jun Bok; Ahn, Young Mee; Yoo, Ga Young","Park, Jung Kyu (Department of Architectural Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Republic of Korea;, gainor888@khu.ac.kr); Lee, Jun Bok (Department of Architectural Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Republic of Korea;, gainor888@khu.ac.kr); Ahn, Young Mee (Department of Environmental Science & Environmental Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Republic of Korea;, ymahn0503@khu.ac.kr, (Y.M.A.);, gayoo@khu.ac.kr, (G.Y.Y.)); Yoo, Ga Young (Department of Environmental Science & Environmental Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 17104, Republic of Korea;, ymahn0503@khu.ac.kr, (Y.M.A.);, gayoo@khu.ac.kr, (G.Y.Y.))","Lee, Jun Bok (Kyung Hee University)","Park, Jung Kyu (Kyung Hee University); Lee, Jun Bok (Kyung Hee University); Ahn, Young Mee (Kyung Hee University); Yoo, Ga Young (Kyung Hee University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings15020216,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1184409843,33 Built Environment and Design; 3301 Architecture; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

financial system by making it truly democratic. In the past decade, blockchain
technology has seen many novel applications ranging from the banking industry
to real estate. However, in order to be adopted universally, blockchain systems
must be scalable to support a high volume of transactions. As we increase the
throughput of the DL system, the underlying peer-to-peer network might face
multiple levels of challenges to keep up with the requirements. Due to varying
network capacities, the slower nodes would be at a relative disadvantage
compared to the faster ones, which could negatively impact their revenue. In
order to quantify their relative advantage or disadvantage, we introduce two
measures of network fairness, $p_f$, the probability of frontrunning and
$\alpha_f$, the publishing fairness. We show that as we scale the blockchain,
both these measures deteriorate, implying that the slower nodes face a
disadvantage at higher throughputs. It results in the faster nodes getting more
than their fair share of the reward while the slower nodes (slow in terms of
network quality) get less. Thus, fairness and scalability in blockchain systems
do not go hand in hand.
  In a setting with rational miners, lack of fairness causes miners to deviate
from the ""longest chain rule"" or undercut, which would reduce the blockchain's
resilience against byzantine adversaries. Hence, fairness is not only a
desirable property for a blockchain system but also essential for the security
of the blockchain and any scalable blockchain protocol proposed must ensure
fairness.",,,arXiv,,,,2021-02-08,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Jain, Anurag; Siddiqui, Shoeb; Gujar, Sujit","Jain, Anurag (); Siddiqui, Shoeb (); Gujar, Sujit ()",,"Jain, Anurag (); Siddiqui, Shoeb (); Gujar, Sujit ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135381956,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

The analysis included stock-specific data, COVID-19 metrics, and macroeconomic indicators from January 2019 to July 2022. This study employs generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to estimate volatility and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the form of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify significant factors driving stock volatility during the pandemic. The findings reveal significant volatility increases at the onset of the pandemic, with government stringency measures leading to increased volatility in larger exchanges, while the introduction of vaccination programs helped to reduce volatility. Weaker macroeconomic fundamentals impact volatility in smaller exchanges. The healthcare sector has emerged as the most resilient, while non-essential sectors, such as consumer discretionary, materials, and real estate, face greater vulnerability, especially in smaller exchanges. The research findings reveal that the heightened stock market volatility observed was mainly a result of the government’s actions to combat the spread of the pandemic, rather than its outbreak.

 1. INTRODUCTION
 Pakistan’s real estate market emerges as a potential economic powerhouse, with a substantial portion of the nation’s wealth concentrated within its real estate assets, estimated at 60-70 percent. While the sector contributes around 2 percent to the GDP, the combined impact of housing and construction reaches nearly 9 percent. The value of Pakistan’s real estate sector, evaluated at approximately $700 billion by the Federal Board of Revenue, signifies its economic significance. Impressively, returns on investment can soar beyond 100 percent (Ouattara et al., 2018). However, this promising market is juxtaposed against a backdrop of challenges and disparities. Pakistan’s population, surpassing 225 million, expands annually at a 2.4 percent rate, characterised by an average household size of 6.5 (Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, 2019). With a yearly housing requirement of 700,000 units, merely half of this demand is met, leading to an alarming gap of roughly 10 million units (Rizvi, 2018). This housing shortage necessitates innovative strategies, particularly in the realm of low-cost housing schemes. The intricacies of property valuation further complicate the real estate landscape. Government land acquisitions relying on DC valuation tables often incite public protests due to perceived undervaluation (Sabir et al., 2017). The importance of precise valuation for equitable compensation is underscored by research (Malaitham et al., 2020). Notably, property valuation is not just pivotal for buyers and sellers; it resonates with stakeholders such as investors, banks, agents, and insurers. The geographical location holds substantial influence over a property’s price, further emphasising the necessity for accurate valuation (Mankad, 2021).
 In dynamically growing cities, the accurate prediction of urban land use evolution plays a pivotal role in fostering sustainable urban planning (Liang et al., 2018) such as Lahore and Faisalabad in Pakistan. Notably, vast untapped potential resides within public properties, including Government Officers Residences (GORs) and railway lands, representing latent avenues for wealth creation. Leveraging these assets effectively can substantially contribute to economic prosperity. The implications of this study extend to policymakers, offering insights to navigate the intricate domains of housing and urban development. A robust housing market stands as a linchpin of a resilient economy; however, Pakistan’s housing sector faces an intricate array of challenges. Urbanisation and migration galvanise demand within urban centers, an issue compounded by insufficient supply catalysed by diverse factors. Shortcomings in land usage, planning, and property rights impede progress, while inadequate revenue collection from property taxes curtails infrastructure financing. The labyrinthine regulations further stall land development, exacerbating housing availability discrepancies, particularly pronounced in megacities like Karachi and Lahore. Notably, housing construction trails behind the meteoric pace of population expansion. Skyrocketing market conditions render housing unattainable for many, channeling them towards informal settlements (Dowall & Ellis, 2009; Haque, 2015; Wani et al., 2020; Yuen & Choi, 2012). The challenges are particularly pronounced within Punjab’s housing markets, accentuated in cities like Lahore and Faisalabad, grappling with deficits in affordable housing (Malik et al., 2020; Wajahat, 2012). A glaring obstacle lies in the hands of speculative investors who control 75 percent of residential plots, perpetuating this complex issue (Zaman & Baloch, 2011). This practice thrives on secure real estate investments and tax loopholes, compounding the predicament. Although plot prices surge significantly (Gul et al., 2018), official valuations lag behind, generating volatility in Pakistan’s property prices. The repercussions of such fluctuations extend to the public, shouldering the burden of investor gains. Despite intermittent housing policies, the issue remains inadequately addressed, emphasising the urgency of public sector interventions to stabilise spiraling prices (Ahmed et al., 2021).",,,Pakistan Development Review,,,,2023-11-29,2023,2023-11-29,,,,493-520,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Khalid, Shoaib; Zameer, Fariha","Khalid, Shoaib (); Zameer, Fariha ()",,"Khalid, Shoaib (); Zameer, Fariha ()",0,0,,0.0,http://thepdr.pk/index.php/pdr/article/download/3243/3812,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168650094,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Despite early skepticism and regulatory challenges, DAOs have evolved into various forms, particularly Investment DAOs, which facilitate pooled asset management and democratize investment opportunities across sectors such as Web3 and real estate tokenization. Given this evolution, a comprehensive financial framework is urgently needed to address the specific governance structures of DAOs. Traditional financial metrics like the Current Ratio, Cash Flow Management, and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) must be adapted to the unique dynamics of decentralized organizations, promoting a deeper understanding of financial health and operational efficiency while ensuring transparency and accountability. As DAOs now manage treasuries exceeding $40 billion, robust financial oversight is essential. Integrating traditional accounting principles with blockchain’s transparency can revolutionize financial reporting, risk management, and governance, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and fostering trust and collaboration within the DAO ecosystem. This fusion of accounting methods and technology will not only enhance internal governance but also ensure sustainable growth. In conclusion, the increasing prominence of DAOs within the financial landscape highlights the need for forward-looking financial structures that blend established accounting practices with cutting-edge technological solutions, ensuring their continued success in a rapidly changing environment.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,2024,2024,2024,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Di Terlizzi, Rocco Francesco Vittorio","Di Terlizzi, Rocco Francesco Vittorio (Link Campus University)",,"Di Terlizzi, Rocco Francesco Vittorio (Link Campus University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1183656600,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",
952,pub.1141845976,10.1360/tb-2020-1536,,,Flood risk dynamics and adaptation analyses for coastal cities based on internet big data and hydrology-hydrodynamic models,"Climate change, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and rapid urbanization are likely to increase flood risk in low-lying coastal cities in the future, posing serious challenges to urban sustainability. To quantitatively assess the future trends of flood risks and to carry out effective adaptation measures are among the hot topics for flood risk management. A sound answer needs fine-scale data to support an integrative analysis of hydrology-hydrodynamic processes, socio-economic impacts, and adaptation measures. In this regard, this paper puts forward a set of multidisciplinary and comprehensive methods to address the frontier scientific issues. First, internet big data and machine learning methods were adopted to map the building footprint, height, and its economic values, providing a fine-scale spatial and economic information of elements at risk. The residential building footprint was mapped with an accuracy of 92.8%, and the housing price was derived via web crawler from different online real estate websites. Second, the hydrology-hydrodynamic models of TOMAWAC, TELEMAC and MIKE 1D/2D were integrated to simulate four storm-surge flooding scenarios. The scenarios are based on the real Typhoon event TC9711 on August 18, 1997, whereby the wind, wave, tide, 1D flood, and 2D flood processes are simulated and flood scenarios of four different return periods are extrapolated. Especially, for future scenarios in 2050, sea level rise and land subsidence are also considered. Third, the expected annual damage (EAD) is estimated via risk analysis technique with combination of flood maps in the four return periods and the fine-scale exposure data. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two flood adaptation measures, i.e., dry flood-proofing and wet flood-proofing measures, for residential buildings. Taking Shanghai as an example, the above methods were applied to comprehensively assess the storm-caused flood risk of residential buildings, its future trends to 2050, and the costs and benefits of two adaptation measures. The results show that: (1) Sea-level rise and land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in Shanghai. (2) Under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP8.5 High-end), the area of exposed residential buildings in Shanghai by 2050 may reach 31−49 km2 (4%–6% of total building area) for a 1/200-year storm flood event and 180–206 km2 (14%–16%) for a 1/5000-year event. (3) The EAD of residential buildings in 2017 is 440 million CNY (65.4 million USD), which can increase 1.6–2.0 times and reach to CNY 700 million–900 million (104.0 million–133.8 million USD) in 2050. (4) The implementation of both dry and wet flood-proofing measures could potentially reduce the EAD by 76%–79% and 88%–90%, respectively. Both measures are considerably cost-effective: the net present values of dry and wet flood-proofing measures are 2.84 billion–5.53 billion CNY (0.4 billion–0.8 billion USD) and 5.85 billion–9.94 billion CNY (0.9 billion–1.5 billion USD), and the benefit/cost ratios are 1.9–2.4 and 7.9–9.8 respectively. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness of dry flood-proofing measures is less than that of wet measure. Our findings can provide both scientific understanding and effective adaptation measures for mitigating the future flood risk in Shanghai. These multidisciplinary methods could also be applied to assess flood risk and adaptation strategies in other coastal cities.",,,Chinese Science Bulletin (Chinese Version),,,,2021-01-27,2021,2021-01-27,2021-10-01,66,28-29,3772-3784,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Shan, Xinmeng; Du, Shiqiang; Wang, Luyang; Zhang, Min; Li, Weijiang; Hu, Hengzhi; Wen, Jiahong","Shan, Xinmeng (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Du, Shiqiang (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;; Institute of Urban Studies, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Wang, Luyang (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Zhang, Min (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;; State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, China); Li, Weijiang (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Hu, Hengzhi (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;); Wen, Jiahong (School of Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China;)",,"Shan, Xinmeng (Shanghai Normal University); Du, Shiqiang (Shanghai Normal University; Shanghai Normal University); Wang, Luyang (Shanghai Normal University); Zhang, Min (Shanghai Normal University; East China Normal University); Li, Weijiang (Shanghai Normal University); Hu, Hengzhi (Shanghai Normal University); Wen, Jiahong (Shanghai Normal University)",10,7,,3.04,https://www.sciengine.com/doi/pdf/A4655197B688492EBE0FDA4E9E04D985,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141845976,37 Earth Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4015 Maritime Engineering,13 Climate Action

It traces the events from 2013 to 2014, when Mozambican state-owned companies borrowed approximately $1.15 billion, ostensibly for tuna fishing and maritime security, which led to massive financial misappropriation. The scandal caused Mozambique’s currency to plummet and led to international financial support withdrawal. Key figures, including Mozambican officials and business executives, faced legal actions, emphasising intertwined corruption levels. The scandal highlighted banking and regulatory oversight lapses, necessitating stronger due diligence and anti-corruption measures in international finance. It serves as a case study of ethical practices and corporate responsibility in global finance, underscoring the need for improved governance and accountability. This chapter examines the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023, a significant event in the banking sector, highlighting vulnerabilities within specialised financial institutions and their implications for the global financial system. SVB’s downfall, marked by the second-largest bank failure in US history, was precipitated by strategic decisions, external economic factors, and a loosened regulatory environment. The chapter discusses the bank’s history, its strategic focus on the tech sector, and the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in its financial trajectory. It details the critical events leading to the collapse, including the bank’s investment strategy, interest rate impacts, and the resultant bank run. The regulatory and governmental response, including Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) intervention and the Federal Reserve’s liquidity support, is analysed for its role in mitigating broader financial impacts and preventing systemic contagion. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the broader implications of the collapse, including policy and regulatory considerations, lessons for the banking industry, and the future of banking regulations. This chapter critically examines the phenomenon of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), discussing their rise in the digital era and the issues surrounding them. NFTs, unique digital assets verified using blockchain technology, have gained prominence in art, music, gaming, and real estate. While providing new avenues for verifying authenticity and ownership, NFTs have also been associated with scams, environmental concerns, and speculative bubbles. The chapter explores various NFT scams, their impact on the market, and the persistence of wealth disparity in NFT holdings. It also discusses the profitability trends of NFTs, including the resilience of certain projects despite market downturns. The chapter highlights the significant growth of the NFT market, its correlation with cryptocurrency markets, and the performance of different platforms in NFT transactions. Additionally, it presents a micro-trend analysis revealing inequalities in market distribution and the challenges of liquidity in the NFT space. The chapter concludes by reflecting on the broader implications of NFTs in the digital economy, their role in market dynamics, and the need for caution and critical engagement with this emerging technology. This article discusses the potential vulnerabilities in European Money Market Funds (MMFs) despite significant reforms implemented in response to the 2008 global financial crisis. It discusses the signs of strain observed in MMFs during March 2020. The primary vulnerability of MMFs lies in their offering of daily liquidity to investors while investing in securities that may prove challenging or even impossible to sell during times of financial stress. The empirical research to date emphasises the importance of understanding how investors respond to regulatory thresholds, especially concerning the risk of a mass withdrawal, or ‘run’, in MMFs with the most substantial liquidity mismatches. The article also discusses the evolving regulatory framework for MMFs in the context of the broader work being undertaken internationally in developing a macroprudential framework for investment funds. This chapter explores the evolution and regulation of private equity and hedge funds after the global financial crisis. It highlights their growth and varying performance, contrasting views on private equity fund success. The focus shifts to regulatory changes, notably the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive in the EU, examining their impact on these funds. Debates over the necessity and effect of regulation on fund performance and risk are presented. The chapter concludes by discussing the influence of regulatory differences on fund riskreturn profiles and the potential shift of fund advisers to less regulated environments. This chapter delves into wine investment, specifically focusing on Bordeaux and Burgundy wines. It explores the regions’ unique characteristics, post-WWII industry changes, and classification systems impacting market value. Key points include data sources for wine investment, the contrasting climates and grape varieties of Bordeaux and Burgundy, and the influence of scarcity and producer reputation on wine prices. The chapter also examines “The Place”, a wine marketplace, and the En primeur system, highlighting their roles in wine investment. Overall, it provides insights into the factors making Bordeaux and Burgundy wines highly valued in the investment sector. This chapter explores the viability of wine as an alternative investment category, comparing it to traditional financial instruments and other alternative investments like art. It delves into the historical context of wine investment, its evolving market dynamics, and the factors influencing its investment potential. The chapter examines various aspects of wine investment, including rate of return, market variability, correlation with financial instruments, and the impact of regulatory and taxation aspects. It also addresses the practicalities of investing in wine, from direct purchasing to involvement in wine mutual funds, and the associated risks and challenges, such as fraud and market volatility. The chapter concludes with a perspective on wine investment’s relative attractiveness compared to other assets, considering its return, volatility, and potential role in portfolio diversification.

The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of existing approaches and research regarding the use of artificial intelligence systems (AI) to identify stock market manipulation. The quote above outlines the high-speed and increasingly autonomous, AI-driven nature of financial markets and trading activity. The opacity and potential dynamic learning ability of AI trading systems operating at incredible speeds within markets presents an increasing risk to supervisory market authorities. In response to this challenge, a range of supervisory authorities are adopting AI systems as a potential tool of identification, prediction, and investigation of novel and existing forms of market manipulation. Market manipulation can take a variety of forms and significantly impact the reputation and integrity of both traders and market authorities. This chapter will explore AI systems and forms of market manipulation. It will then detail and analyse emerging literature outlining AI systems which may support efforts to identify and understand market manipulation. Defining AI can itself be a contested area and throughout this chapter the definition adopted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is used of AI systems. This definition encompasses a variety of and is defined as a ‘machine-based system that is capable of influencing the environment by producing an output (predictions, recommendations or decisions) for a given set of objectives. It uses machine and/or human-based data and inputs to (i) perceive real and/or virtual environments; (ii) abstract these perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner (e.g., with machine learning), or manually; and (iii) use model inference to formulate options for outcomes. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy’. This research investigates the implications of the insolvency of the FTX exchange and subsequent bankruptcy. Both events have negatively impacted the broader cryptocurrency industry, largely due to a comprehensive failure in risk management. Findings suggest that the depreciation of privately issued cryptocurrencies, namely FTT and Serum, was a direct antecedent to FTX’s downfall and the consequent knock-on effects on diverse financial market instruments. The FTX collapse should be interpreted as a stark cautionary signal for policymakers and regulators, especially in relation to the valuation, ownership, and corporate employment of permissionless, privately issued cryptocurrencies. This chapter discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in combating market manipulation within financial markets. It begins by defining market manipulation and its impact on market integrity and investor confidence. The chapter then explores the integration of AI in market surveillance systems, highlighting AI’s ability to analyse vast datasets and identify complex patterns indicative of manipulative activities. It delves into the multifaceted role of AI, including real-time monitoring of trade data, analysing communication patterns, and predicting potential manipulation scenarios. It further addresses the challenges in adopting AI, such as data privacy, ethical use, and transparency in decision-making. It also examines the effectiveness of AI in identifying fraud and reducing false positives, emphasising AI’s adaptability and continuous learning capabilities. The chapter concludes by exploring the implications of AI’s integration in market surveillance, stressing the need for regulatory responses, ethical considerations, and future developments in AI technology for financial markets. This includes the advancement of predictive analytics, global collaboration initiatives, and continuous learning capabilities of AI systems, all aimed at enhancing market integrity and investor protection.",,,,,"Shaen Corbet, Charles Larkin",,2024-07-03,2024,2024-07-03,2024-07-08,1,,,Closed,Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173516739,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Their spontaneous yet sporadic occurrence has made mitigation measures a cumbersome task; moreover, current trends regarding anthropogenic activities, especially in agriculture and industry portend further undesirable events. Apart from the aesthetic degeneration they create in their respective habitats, they are equally capable of secreting toxins, which altogether present grave environmental and medical consequences. In this paper, we gave an update on factors that influence cHABs, cyanotoxin exposure routes, and environmental public health implications, especially impacts on fish, pets, and livestock. We discussed social economic impacts, risk assessment, and management problems for cHABs and, thereafter, assessed the extant management approaches including prevention, control, and mitigation of the proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms. In light of this, we suggest that more intensified research should be directed to the standardization of procedures for cyanotoxin analysis. Also, the provision of standardized reference material for the quantification of cyanotoxins is vital for routine monitoring as well as the development of strong in situ sensors capable of quantifying and detecting HABs cells and toxins in waterbodies to prevent the adverse impacts of cHABs.

China, Brazil, U.S., etc.), the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2015, the COVID-19 Pandemic, cross-border spillovers and the failures of risk-regulation/government-stimulus programs (enacted during 2007-2020) have significantly affected economic systems, financial markets, social networks and environmental compliance worldwide, especially in emerging markets. The foregoing raises significant economic psychology and policy-making questions about the causes and measurement of cross-border spillovers (from developed countries to emerging markets), and evolving relationships among cross-border spillovers, legal/regulatory institutions, foreign aid, political systems, government size, social-welfare, fintech-platforms, asset-market dynamics (volatility, market-depth, liquidity, pension/retirement, remittances, business/consumer confidence; etc.) and sustainable growth. This book is the first of two volumes, re-defines geopolitical risk and addresses these issues in the context of the role of constitutional economics and economic psychology (especially households and companies) as tools for global sustainable growth and risk management. This book can help researchers develop better Artificial Intelligence, Complex Systems and decision-theory models of geopolitical risk, public policy, asset-pricing, global corporate strategy and international capital flows, all of which are increasingly relevant to investment managers, corporate executives, boards-of-directors and government officials.

This will allow developing recommendations for the government, business, and educational institutions on effective strategies for adapting the labor market to new realities, ensuring employment stability, and stimulating the country's economic recovery. The purpose of the article is to comprehensively analyze the impact of crisis factors on the Ukrainian labor market, identify the main problems and trends that have arisen as a result of the war, and develop ways to address them. The results of the study show that the Ukrainian labor market has proved to be particularly sensitive to the changes caused by the hostilities that began in 2022. During this period, there was a pronounced reduction in the number of jobs, especially in non-budget sectors, and a rapid increase in unemployment. A significant decline in the number of employees was recorded in various industries, including the construction and real estate sectors. In contrast, some industries, such as agriculture, showed greater resilience, maintaining stable employment levels. Employers face challenges in recruiting staff, pointing to a lack of qualified candidates and their inadequate training. Among the key trends observed in the labor market in 2022-2023 are the growing demand for universal competencies, the importance of English language proficiency and artificial intelligence skills. The development of remote work has also become a significant factor affecting the employment and recruitment processes. In general, the labor market in Ukraine shows the ability to adapt and recover from the military turmoil, but continues to face a number of challenges that require focused attention and strategic intervention from the government, business, and educational institutions. This study aims to identify the key problems faced by the Ukrainian labor market and suggest possible solutions, which is important for the country's further economic recovery and development.",,,Actual Problems of Economics,,,,2024-01,2024,,2024-01,1,271,55-65,Closed,Article,"Atamaniuk, Ruslan","Atamaniuk, Ruslan ()",,"Atamaniuk, Ruslan ()",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172797017,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

644,pub.1169593191,10.5194/egusphere-egu24-883,,,Addressing the data-practice feedback loop in land use modeling for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region,"Land use change modeling is a complex process that necessitates considering factors such as governmental policies, bureaucratic and political influences, private real estate markets, and human settlement patterns. In regions with limited data availability, like South Asia, constructing accurate quantitative models becomes particularly challenging, despite their potential benefits. The rapid pace of urbanization, coupled with long planning cycles, widens the gap between data acquisition and practical implementation. Modelers often have to rely on inputs from stakeholders and experts, emphasizing the need for a more resource-efficient and expedited feedback loop between data and practice. This study underscores the establishment of a robust data to practice knowledge feedback loop to enhance the effectiveness of quantitative land-use models, to capture the dynamics of rapidly evolving urban areas. Such a loop can facilitate improved land use models that serve as powerful decision-making tools for urban environments and addressing challenges posed by climate change. In this study, we investigate strategies to strengthen the data-practice feedback loop using our ongoing work in developing a land use model for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), one of the world's fastest-growing regions and one that highlights the demand for data-driven resilience planning. Our methodology employs a spatially explicit land use modeling framework (Metronamica) supported by a cellular automata (CA) algorithm. This framework accommodates various drivers and processes crucial for evaluating land use dynamics across sectors and incorporates expert inputs during model setup.  The limited research in cellular automata for the South Asian context is due to intricacies of land use interactions, data scarcity, focus on economics by more complex CA models, and the lack of transparency in artificial neural network models, all of which pose challenges for their use in planning. To address these concerns, our study adopts a hybrid approach, combining a foundational CA model with automation and expert inputs to create a faster, traceable, and nuanced model. We also highlight the challenges of building a land-use model as robust evidence for planners, examining aspects of data availability, accessibility, data processing and digitization, and format variations. Additionally, we discuss the use of Python modules to automate model calibration and emphasize the importance of expert feedback in refining the model and translating policies into quantitative inputs. The methods and insights emerging from this study shed light on critical questions, such as defining the criteria for a ""good enough"" land use model, integrating on-ground expertise into quantitative modeling, and improving data processes to support more efficient, rapid, and accurate model setups. This approach aims to bridge the gap between data acquisition and practical application in a resource-efficient manner. In conclusion, we advocate for the adoption of mixed data creation to develop useful land-use models for emerging regions. We anticipate that the insights from this study will contribute to the establishment of more robust and concise data-practice feedback cycles in data-scarce urban environments. This, in turn, can empower data-driven decision-makers to incorporate their expertise into quantitative modeling, fostering adaptable and resilient cities while giving decision-makers greater control over the process.",,,,,,,2024-03-08,2024,2024-03-08,,,,,Closed,Article,"Rajeev Lokare, Sayali; Krishnan, Supriya; Van Delden, Hedwig; Ekbote, Abhijit","Rajeev Lokare, Sayali (); Krishnan, Supriya (); Van Delden, Hedwig (); Ekbote, Abhijit ()",,"Rajeev Lokare, Sayali (); Krishnan, Supriya (); Van Delden, Hedwig (); Ekbote, Abhijit ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169593191,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning,15 Life on Land
