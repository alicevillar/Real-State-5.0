The period of confinement directly affected our routines and transformed our consumption habits. Amidst the fear of contagion and uncertainty, people isolated themselves and postponed changes. Previous studies indicate that digital practices were accelerated after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitating communication and improving the performance of various sectors of the economy. Thus, to better understand the behavior of Brazilian real estate market professionals in this period, the objective of this research was to verify whether the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the process of perception of digitalization in real estate websites. To this end, five experts in the digital real estate market were interviewed, asked what are the main items that a quality real estate website should have to improve user experience. Based on the items selected by the experts, a questionnaire was developed and a question was constructed for each item. The questionnaire was sent online to 2144 realtors, asking about the importance of these items before and after the pandemic started. Using a 5-point Likert scale, and strict criteria for analysis, our survey yielded 423 valid responses. The results indicate that regardless of the groups analyzed, the hypotheses confirm that after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the perception of the importance of digital technology in Brazilian real estate websites was enhanced, increased. Managers took advantage of the pandemic and the availability of digital technology to offer specialized service to customers, thus creating a new competitive scenario. The tools associated with the visualization of the property and information such as ‘360°/Video Tour’, ‘Video Visit Broadcast’, ‘Chatbots’ and ‘FAQ List’ had the greatest increase in perception.",,This research was funded by CNPq (The Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development).,Quality & Quantity,,,,2022-06-21,2022,2022-06-21,2023-06,57,3,2165-2181,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Moro, Matheus Fernando; de Souza Mendonça, Anny Key; de Andrade, Dalton Francisco","Moro, Matheus Fernando (Production Engineering Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, PO Box 476, 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil); de Souza Mendonça, Anny Key (Graduate Program in Production Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, PO Box 476, 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil); de Andrade, Dalton Francisco (Department of Informatic and Statistics, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, PO Box 476, 88040-900, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil)","Moro, Matheus Fernando (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina)","Moro, Matheus Fernando (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina); de Souza Mendonça, Anny Key (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina); de Andrade, Dalton Francisco (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina)",11,10,0.75,8.16,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11135-022-01449-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148809443,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4905 Statistics,

This enhanced functionality enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, Mobile Apps, Virtual Reality (VR) and 5G does not only translate into a superior user experience; technology also supports sustainability and energy consumption to meet regulation (ESG, NZC) while optimising asset management and operations for enhanced business economic performance. The main peculiarity is that technology is standardised, ubiquitous and independent from the physical built assets whereas asset users including humans, machines and devices are also common to different assets. This article analyses the atomic differences between built assets and proposes an asset omni-management model based on micro-management of services that will support the macro-functionality of the asset. The proposed key concept is based on the standardisation of different assets based on common and specific functionality and services delivered by the technology stack that is supporting already the transition to Industry 5.0 based on Web 3.0 and Tokenisation.","Will Serrano, the author of this article, would like to express gratitude to Tim Broyd @UCL for his personal and academic support writing this challenging article.

Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating all economic sectors, and its impact will be transformational. Much has been written about AI, and pundits are weighing in on how it will affect corporate real estate (CRE) in fundamental ways. Within the industry, there is an ever-expanding range of case studies highlighting individual applications and how their adoption will dramatically increase efficiency and insight, but from a macro perspective, how can the concept of AI be explained in straightforward terms to a practitioner? In this paper, the author, who in 2014 contributed a piece to Corporate Real Estate Journal about the mounting influence of performance metrics,3 elevates the discussion by explaining how these pockets of data can be algorithmically synthesised to create greater levels of insight. It becomes the basis upon how organisations can create a plan for integrating AI by explaining the basic concepts, outlining the components of a data strategy, explaining the need to maximise user experience and discuss the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT).

Many of these messages may appear legitimate, but turn into spam when they are posted redundantly. This behavior drowns out other legitimate users from having their voices heard. We label this problem as automation spam – legitimate messages that are posted at a rate that overwhelms normal posts. In this paper, we characterize automation on a popular classifieds website, Craigslist, and find that 2/3rd of the posts with URLs are automated. Automation is most prevalent in categories dominated by businesses, such as Tickets, Cars by Dealer, and Real Estate, with 67–92 % of the posts with URLs exhibiting automation. Even in categories with less automation, intermittent automation still overwhelms non-automated users, demonstrating that no category is safe.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Passive and Active Measurement,"Thomas Karagiannis, Xenofontas Dimitropoulos",,2016-03-24,2016,2016-03-24,2016,9631,,248-260,Closed,Chapter,"Kaizer, Andrew J.; Gupta, Minaxi; Sajib, Mejbaol; Acharjee, Anirban; Ismail, Qatrunnada","Kaizer, Andrew J.

1441,pub.1121112611,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113804,,,Understanding citizen perspectives on open urban energy data through the development and testing of a community energy feedback system,"With the rise of advanced and affordable sensors offering continuous monitoring of city infrastructure, cities are increasingly seeking to become more ‘smart’ and are adopting data-driven approaches to help meet sustainability goals. In the area of building energy efficiency, closely coupled with this effort is the prevalence of building energy benchmarking policies, which require public disclosure of vast new quantities of building-level energy data at urban scales (i.e., open urban energy data). While existing research efforts have focused on the potential of this data to transform energy efficiency markets and investments in the real estate sector, little research has been dedicated to assessing this information’s value to the general public. Given that achieving energy reductions in the built environment will require not only energy efficiency investments, but also greater awareness, engagement, and action from ordinary citizens, we study the potential of open urban energy data in providing citizen benefits. Energy-cyber-physical systems offer a pertinent framework to link data from the virtual world to citizens’ physical reality in order to improve their understanding and decision making. Adopting an energy-cyber-physical system perspective, we aim to connect open urban energy data to citizens through the development and evaluation of a novel community-scale energy feedback system. This mobile cyber-physical system transforms building-level electricity consumption and production data across Georgia Tech’s campus into a mobile application consisting of three features: spatial feedback, energy supply feedback, and energy consumption feedback. Augmented-reality visualization elements are integrated into the system, providing Georgia Tech community members a direct link between their experienced physical environment and data stored in the virtual world. Applying a user-centered design approach, prospective users evaluate the system via thinking aloud sessions and user surveys to assess understandings and perceptions of open urban energy data for the Georgia Tech campus. The results contribute to literature seeking to create energy feedback systems at the community-scale and expand research investigating citizen reactions to and opinions of open urban energy data. This research is an integral step to further engagement and participation from the public to help achieve a sustainable and citizen-valued energy future.","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. DGE-1650044 and No. CPS-1837021.

989,pub.1112117306,10.1108/f-11-2017-0112,,,The conditions data model supporting building information models in facility management,"Purpose
                    This paper aims to describe how building information model (BIM) and big data can be combined in the same interface for providing new value to stakeholders, such as the property owner and user, as well as property service and workplace service companies. The research presents a new concept, which shows how the BIM can be exploited efficiently during maintenance.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Initially, existing facility management (FM) processes were investigated to find out how to digitize them and identify bottlenecks. Second, BIM’s data content was explored to identify the information that could be used to streamline FM processes. Third, the potential of the active data measured in the building was evaluated. Finally, research was undertaken to find out how constantly fluctuating information can be combined with BIM objects and what kind of added value that combination could offer. The literature review was used to support the primary contribution. In addition, the research problems were described and the basics of the research were obtained by interviews. The author has interviewed 27 professionals from several stakeholders.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The first finding is that the BIM can serve as a platform for building use, various services and management when it has been adequately generated during the planning and construction phases and enriched before being commissioned. The other essential finding is the theory of conditions data model (CDM), which is a technical environment that combines active data with BIM. The most important advantages of BIM in FM are as follows: • Building owner attains better user satisfaction, acquires better quality and smarter services, saves energy, ensures better indoor conditions and improves building profitability. • Service providers can develop and offer new services, speed up operations, save resources and generate more profits. • The occupant gets a better user experience, faster and higher quality services and better indoor conditions.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The CDM enables to generate for the real estate and construction (RE&C) sector a novel BIM-based ecosystem with standard rules, instead of every individual operator developing his/her own unique solution for BIM use in FM. This will have an impact on the entire RE&C sector’s operating methods and will have significant financial implications in the near future. Application of this research is limited to office buildings where indoor condition measuring is undertaken continuously and where the knowledge of the use cases of spaces is available. In addition, the proper BIM in the Industry Foundation Classes format must exist. The evaluation of the validity of big data is not discussed in this article. Visualization of data and content of user interfaces will be the topic of another article by the author. This article does not deal with intricate technical details, but crucial issues are defined.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    The article presents a unique method for BIM use in FM. The theory of CDM (how to combine active data with BIM) is completely new and a similar solution has not been presented earlier.

Augmented Reality (AR) technology presents an opportunity to transform these experiences by turning static, flat artwork into dynamic, multi-dimensional presentations. However, creating and integrating video or dynamic content can be time-consuming and challenging, requiring meticulous planning, design, and production. In the context of urban renewal and community revitalization, particularly in China’s first-tier cities where real estate development has saturated the market, there is a growing trend to repurpose traditional commercial and office spaces with cultural and artistic exhibitions. These exhibitions not only enhance the spatial quality but also elevate the user experience, making the spaces more competitive. However, these non-traditional exhibition venues often lack the amenities of professional galleries, relying on walls, windows, and corners for displays, and requiring quick setup times. For visitors, who are often office workers or shoppers with limited time, the use of personal mobile devices for interaction is common. WeChat, China’s most widely used mobile application, provides a platform for convenient digital interactive experiences through mini-programs, which can support lightweight AR applications. AI video generation technologies, such as Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (ControlNet) and Latent Consistency Models (LCM), have seen significant advancements. These technologies now allow for the creation of 3D models and video content from text and images. Tools like Meshy and Pika provide the ability to generate various video styles and offer precise control over video content. New AI video applications like Stable Video further expand the possibilities by rapidly converting static images into dynamic videos, facilitating easy adjustments and edits. This paper explores the application of AR-based AI video generation technology in enhancing the experience of painting exhibitions. By integrating these technologies, traditional paintings can be transformed into interactive, engaging displays that enrich the viewer’s experience. The study demonstrates the potential of these innovations to make art exhibitions more appealing and competitive in various public spaces, thereby improving both artistic expression and audience engagement.",The author would like to thank all the staff involved in the exhibition and the visitors for their participation and support.,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,HCI International 2024 – Late Breaking Papers,"Panayiotis Zaphiris, Andri Ioannou, Robert A.

In addition, the lack of information and the impossibility of previewing the right path, have negative influence on user’s experience. However, Extended Reality (XR) gives the opportunity to guide users by clarifying these paths and even accompanying them through it. Throughout recent years, new technologies are being applied for building 3D models and simulating 3D spaces to make virtual visits, as it happens in real estate sales, where through 360-degree views and the associated photographic technologies, and using specialized processing and assembly software, it is possible to visit homes for sale or museums, just applying the same concepts. These applications are limited to a degree of immersion that we classify as level 1, that just permits to visit and navigate the 3D model interacting with a screen by means of Augmented Reality (AR). More-over, Virtual Reality (VR) opens the possibility to increase the immersion level and to join the user during his journey by means of different devices. For level 2, instructions for using headphones can be provided to the user along his way just geolocating his position inside the building. For level 3, the use of headphones and special glasses increases the possibilities of immersion and shows the route to follow by using both acoustic and visual procedures. This classification in immersion degrees can be associated with the various needs of users, especially with those who are the most vulnerable. It can be considered as a guide that is structured by layers, where the basic level is Augmented Reality (AR) that depends on simple devices. For increasing degrees of immersion, support devices and Virtual Reality (VR) must be added. On the other hand, the layers flexibility permits to combine the usability of these devices according to the needs or prefer-ences of each user, covering all possible vulnerabilities. To proceed with such virtual aids, it is essential to use Extended Reality (XR) together with Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS technology and 3D modeling. These tools, when accompanied by the adequate signage, will make navigating inside and outside health centers a less stressful experience for users. The Príncipe de Asturias University Hospital (HUPA) in Alcalá de Henares (Spain) is used as a case study.","This work is a result of the research project Metodología para el diseño de edificios, entornos y espacios asistenciales sostenibles centrados en el bienestar de pacientes especialmente vulnerables: terminales, con discapacidades sensoriales y/o motoras, y enfermos post COVID-19 de larga duración funded by the Ministry of Innovation and Science of Spain, in the call Proyectos de I+D+i en el marco de los Programas Estatales de Generación de Conocimiento y Fortalecimiento Científico y Tecnológico del sistema de I+D+i y de I+D+i orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad, call 2020, PID2020-118796RB-I00.

Because of the massive sales to a new crypto audience, the livelihoods of
digital artists are being transformed. It is no surprise that celebs are
jumping on the bandwagon. It is a fact that NFTs can be used in multiple ways,
including digital artwork such as animation, character design, digital
painting, collection of selfies or vlogs, and many more digital entities. As a
result, they may be used to signify the possession of any specific object,
whether it be digital or physical. NFTs are digital tokens that may be used to
indicate ownership of one of a-kind goods. For example, I can buy a shoe or T
shirt from any store, and then if the store provides me the same 3D model of
that T-Shirt or shoe of the exact same design and color, it would be more
connected with my feelings. They enable us to tokenize items such as artwork,
valuables, and even real estate. NFTs can only be owned by one person at a
time, and they are protected by the Ethereum blockchain no one can alter the
ownership record or create a new NFT. The word non-fungible can be used to
describe items like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. It is
impossible to substitute these goods with anything else because they each have
their own distinct characteristics. The goal was to find all the existing
implementations of Non-fungible Tokens in different fields of recent
technology, so that an overall overview of future implementations of NFT can be
found and how it can be used to enrich user experiences.",,,arXiv,,,,2022-09-30,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Alam, A. N. M.
